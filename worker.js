// ---- Bilingual error responses ----------------------------------------
//
// Every error this Worker returns used to be a plain, fixed-language
// `message` string - some written in English, some in Traditional Chinese,
// picked ad hoc by whoever wrote that call site rather than by any
// consistent rule. That made the response impossible for a caller to
// localize (an English-reading Match Find-style consumer would see raw
// Chinese with no way to tell what it meant) and impossible to branch on
// reliably (matching against message text breaks the moment the wording is
// tweaked).
//
// The fix: every error carries a stable, never-translated `code` (for a
// caller that wants to render its own UI string) alongside a `message` that
// is picked at response time from ERROR_MESSAGES based on the request's
// `Accept-Language` header (for a caller that just wants to display
// something reasonable as-is, same as before).
//
// Each language's actual text lives in its own file under locales/ (see
// locales/en.js, locales/zh-TW.js, imported at the top of this file) -
// ERROR_MESSAGES below just zips them together by code, so errorJson() can
// keep doing `ERROR_MESSAGES[code][locale]`. Adding a third language later:
// copy locales/en.js to locales/<code>.js (every code `en` has should exist
// there too), import it above, add one line below, and add a branch to
// pickLocale().
//
// `en` is treated as authoritative for the codes that were already English
// before bilingual support existed (POST_ONLY, INVALID_JSON, etc.) - the
// zh-TW text next to them is a later translation, not a change to English
// callers' behavior. The codes that were already Chinese (RATE_LIMITED,
// DAILY_QUOTA_EXCEEDED, MISSING_API_KEY) keep their
// original zh-TW wording byte-for-byte, with English added alongside.
const ERROR_MESSAGES = Object.fromEntries(
  Object.keys(en).map((code) => [code, { en: en[code], 'zh-TW': zhTW[code] }])

// On its own, `isAllowedOrigin` only feeds corsHeaders - purely ADVISORY, since CORS is a browser-side
// promise, not a server-side one: it stops a well-behaved BROWSER from
// reading a disallowed page's response, but the request itself was always
// fully processed (including the real, billed Gemini call) before that
// browser was ever told no. A direct curl/script call doesn't send or care
// about CORS at all, so every one of these routes was, in practice,
// callable by anyone who simply knew the URL - exactly the exposure a
// public GitHub repo whose client source contains that same URL creates.
//
// GEMINI_BILLED_PATHS makes the check an actual, enforced GATE instead: reject before
// EVER reaching a billed handler if Origin is missing or not in
// ALLOWED_ORIGINS. This costs every real caller nothing - every route this
// applies to is a POST with a JSON body, which browsers always treat as a
// CORS "non-simple" request and always attach a real Origin header to,
// preflight included - so a legitimate call from Orbit/Orbit Vocab's own
// already-working pages is completely unaffected; only a bare
// script/curl call (no Origin at all) or a request from some OTHER site
// embedding a fetch to this Worker (a real Origin, just not an allowed
// one) is newly rejected.
//
// HONEST LIMIT: an Origin header is just text a non-browser client can set
// to whatever it wants - a targeted attacker who reads this file (this is
// a public, open-source repo) can trivially copy the allowed Origin value
// verbatim. This gate stops opportunistic/naive abuse (URL scanners,
// another site's page silently spending your quota through its visitors'
// browsers) and, combined with isDailyGlobalCapped above, hard-bounds the
// worst case even against someone who does spoof it. It is NOT real
// authentication - this app has no user accounts to authenticate, and no
// client-side secret can ever be genuinely secret in a fully public static
// site's own source. Real lock-down would need a backend with real user
// identity, which is a materially bigger change than this route currently
// has any other reason to need.

// Exact copy of the prompt that used to live in src/gemini-ocr.js's
// AIVisionProcessor.buildPrompt() - kept here now instead, since the whole
// point of moving it server-side is that the client no longer sends it.
//
// Single-file, and self-classifying, deliberately: an earlier version split
// this into two separate fixed prompts (a "timetable" one and a
// "registration" one) and had the CLIENT decide, purely from upload order,
// which file went to which - file 1 was always assumed to be the timetable,
// every file after it a registration record. That broke completely the
// moment someone picked the files in the other order: the registration form
// got read as if it were a timetable grid (producing garbage), and the
// actual timetable photo got read as if it were a course list (finding
// nothing to extract). There is no reliable signal in upload order - a file
// picker doesn't know or care what's in the files - so the model has to
// determine this itself instead of trusting how the files arrived. Every
// file now gets exactly this one prompt, and "documentKind" is the model's
// own answer to "what am I looking at", read back by
// src/gemini-ocr.js's recognizeAndMerge to route each file's result
// correctly regardless of what order it was uploaded in.
//
// This does cost a little more per call than the two-separate-prompts
// version did (every call now carries both rule sets, not just the one that
// turned out to matter) - a fixed, modest, worthwhile trade for a bug class
// this is not: getting the whole import right no matter what order the
// files came in, rather than getting it cheaply and only when they came in
// the order the code silently assumed.
// A function of "today" rather than a plain constant: countdownEvents below
// needs a reference date so the model can resolve a year-less calendar date
// (e.g. a poster showing only "1/22", no year) to the correct year itself,
// instead of guessing one with no anchor at all - which in practice skewed
// toward whatever year the model's training data made it default to, often
// landing the "countdown" in the past. Computed fresh per request rather
// than once at module load, since a Worker instance can stay warm across
// requests spanning a real date change.
function buildGeminiPrompt(todayIso) {
  return `Look at the attached file and decide what kind of document it is, then extract accordingly. Return a single JSON object matching this exact schema:
{
  "documentKind": "timetable",
  "bellTimes": [],
  "breakTimes": [{"name":"午休","start":"12:00","end":"13:00"}],
  "classes": [{"key":"c1","subject":"國文","teacher":"陳老師","location":"A101"}, {"key":"c2","subject":"英文","teacher":"王老師","location":"B202"}],
  "weeklySchedule": {"1": ["c1","c2",null], "2": [], "3": [], "4": [], "5": []},
  "reverseWeek": false,
  "courses": [{"subject":"多媒體音樂 I","teacher":"徐蓉莉","location":"","day":1,"periods":[3,4]}],
  "countdownEvents": [{"name":"116 學測","startDate":"2027-01-22","endDate":"2027-01-24"}]
}

First, set "documentKind" to exactly one of:
- "timetable" - the file shows a weekly class schedule grid: a table with days as one axis and periods as the other, each cell showing a subject (and often a teacher/room) for a whole week.
- "registration" - the file is a course-registration confirmation, enrollment list, or similar record: a list or table where each row names one specific course a student is actually taking, generally alongside which day and period(s) it meets. It does NOT show a full weekly grid.
- "other" - neither of the above (an unrelated photo, a notice with no course rows or grid, etc).

Then extract only the fields that match the documentKind you chose, and leave every other field at its empty default (empty array, empty object, or false) rather than guessing or leaving it inconsistent with documentKind. countdownEvents is the one exception - check for it regardless of documentKind, per its own rule below.

If documentKind is "timetable", fill in bellTimes/breakTimes/classes/weeklySchedule/reverseWeek (leave courses as an empty array):
- Read class period times from the image when available. Use 24-hour "HH:MM" strings, one entry per period in order, exactly as shown (either ["08:10","09:00"] or {"start":"08:10","end":"09:00"} is acceptable). Preserve the actual times; never invent, guess, or fall back to standard/default school times. If no class times are visible anywhere, return an empty bellTimes array.
- Identify visible subjects, teachers, classrooms, breaks, and other timetable information.
- classes: one entry per distinct subject actually visible in the photo — do not invent subjects that aren't shown. "key" is your own short identifier for that entry (e.g. "c1", "c2") — it is never shown to anyone, it only links weeklySchedule slots back to this entry, so make each one unique. "subject" is the full Chinese subject name. Use "" for teacher/location when that information is not readable.
- Every entry in classes MUST be placed at least once in weeklySchedule, at the exact day/period position where it visually appears in the grid. A subject you cannot place at a specific day and period is not a recognized class — leave it out of classes entirely rather than adding it unassigned. Do not stop at recognizing a subject's name; always also locate the cell(s) it occupies.
- weeklySchedule: keys "1" through "5" (Monday–Friday) are REQUIRED and must all be present, even as an empty array — never omit or truncate "5" (Friday) even if it is partially cut off in the photo. Add "6" (Saturday) and/or "0" (Sunday) ONLY if the photo actually shows a column for that day; otherwise omit them entirely. Keep each day's array aligned with the detected periods (one entry per bellTimes index). Use null when a slot is genuinely empty or cannot be identified — never fill a blank or unreadable cell by copying in a class from a different day or period just because a slot exists there; every non-null entry must be a "key" that exists in classes.
- If odd/even weeks contain alternatives in the same slot (shown as two stacked subject+teacher pairs, often marked 單/雙 or "odd/even"), read each alternative's subject and its own teacher as two separate pieces of text first, then combine same-role pieces with "/" — all subjects joined into one "/"-separated subject string, all teachers joined the same way into one "/"-separated teacher string, both in the same left-to-right order, as one shared classes entry for that slot. Never fold a teacher's name into the subject string, or vice versa: subject must end up containing only subject names, teacher only teacher names.
- Set reverseWeek to true only when the photo clearly indicates a reversed odd/even week orientation; otherwise false.
- Add breakTimes only for explicitly shown non-class periods such as lunch or cleaning — not empty/free periods.

If documentKind is "registration", fill in courses (leave bellTimes/breakTimes/classes/weeklySchedule empty, reverseWeek false):
- This kind of file's day/period information may be written out plainly, or packed together compactly — one shorthand seen often enough to call out explicitly: a single day character immediately followed by a run of digits with no separator, where each individual digit is its own period number (so a two-digit run like "34" means periods 3 AND 4, both occupied by that one row, never "period 34" or a "3 through 4" range). Whatever notation this file actually uses, decode it using the day-naming and period-numbering it establishes itself.
- courses: one entry per distinct course row actually shown — do not invent rows. "day" is an integer: 1 for Monday through 5 for Friday, 6 for Saturday, 0 for Sunday. "periods" is every period number that row's course occupies, as a plain array of integers in ascending order (e.g. a row spanning two consecutive periods is periods:[3,4], never a combined number like 34 or a string). Use "" for teacher/location when not given or not legible.

Regardless of documentKind:
- Add countdownEvents only for clearly visible events/exams with a readable calendar date, formatted as "YYYY-MM-DD". Set startDate and endDate to the same date for a single-day event; use the visible first and last dates for a multi-day event/exam period. Only include dates you can actually read the day and month of; otherwise return an empty array. A file can carry a countdown/exam notice with no timetable or course-list content at all (documentKind "other") - still report it.
- Today's date is ${todayIso}. If a countdown/exam date shows a day and month but no visible year, infer the year yourself so the resulting date is the nearest upcoming date on or after today: use this year unless that month/day has already passed this year, in which case use next year instead. Never infer a year that puts the event in the past. If a year is actually visible in the photo, always use that one instead, even if it looks like it's already past.
- Do not invent information. When uncertain, prefer an empty value, empty array, or null.
- Every field in the response schema you are given must be present, even when empty.
- Keep all fields internally consistent.
- Return ONLY the raw JSON object — no markdown fences, no comments, no extra text.`;

// scheduleEdits below only ever contain the classes and schedule cells
// actually being added, changed, or removed; everything else is taken
// straight from the client's own current data (see

// so it is structurally impossible for an untouched class or cell to come
// back different. bellTimes/breakTimes/countdownEvents/reverseWeek stay
// whole-value fields (see their own *Changed booleans below) rather than
// getting the same sparse treatment - each is one short list/value already
// sitting fully in view (a handful of periods/breaks/events at most), not
// a few dozen scattered entries, so sparse-patching them would only add
// complexity without meaningfully lowering the same copy risk; the

  return `You read a Traditional Chinese natural-language instruction about a weekly class schedule and return ONLY a sparse patch describing the classes/schedule cells/settings that actually change - never the whole schedule, never anything the instruction didn't ask about. Return a single JSON object matching this exact schema:
{
  "status": "ok",
  "reason": "",
  "classUpserts": [{"key": "A", "subject": "物理", "teacher": "", "location": ""}],
  "deletedClassKeys": [],
  "scheduleEdits": [{"day": 1, "period": 2, "key": "A"}],
  "bellTimesChanged": false,
  "bellTimes": [],
  "breakTimesChanged": false,
  "breakTimes": [],
  "countdownEventsChanged": false,
  "countdownEvents": [],
  "reverseWeekChanged": false,
  "reverseWeek": false
}

THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT RULE: this is a PATCH, not a copy of the schedule. List a class in "classUpserts" only if you are adding it or changing one of its fields; list a key in "deletedClassKeys" only if the instruction removes that class entirely; list an entry in "scheduleEdits" only for a (day, period) cell whose class actually changes. Never include a class, cell, break time, or countdown event just because it already exists - every one the instruction doesn't touch must be left out of the result entirely, never repeated back. This is also why "bellTimesChanged"/"breakTimesChanged"/"countdownEventsChanged"/"reverseWeekChanged" exist: leave the flag false (and its matching field empty/false) whenever the instruction doesn't touch that field at all; set the flag true, and only then fill in the field, when it does. The result is shown to the user as a diff against the current data before anything is saved, so anything you include here that the instruction didn't actually ask for shows up as a confusing, unwanted line in that diff.

Field shapes and meaning:
- "classUpserts": one entry per class being added or changed, as {key, subject, teacher, location} - all four fields are required on every entry you DO include (adding or changing a class replaces that whole entry, so if only the teacher changes, still repeat that same class's existing subject/location unchanged inside this one entry - never touch any other class just to do that). "key" is an internal id, not shown to the user - reuse a class's EXISTING key (from the context below) whenever you're changing that same course, even if you rename its subject/teacher/location, so "scheduleEdits" references to it stay valid. For a genuinely NEW course, invent a short new key not already used by any class in the context (e.g. "new1", "new2", ...); leave teacher/location as "" if the instruction didn't specify them. Defining a new course is a complete, valid request entirely on its own even when the instruction never says where to schedule it (e.g. "新增一個課程叫社團活動", "幫我建一個王老師教的數學課" with no day/period mentioned) - in that case just add it to "classUpserts" with a new key and leave "scheduleEdits" empty; never invent a day/period for it just because a course needs one eventually - the user places it into a slot themselves afterward.
- "deletedClassKeys": keys (from the context below) of classes the instruction removes entirely. Also add a "scheduleEdits" entry with "key": "" for every cell in the context that still references a deleted key, so nothing is left pointing at a class that no longer exists.
- "scheduleEdits": one entry per (day, period) cell whose class actually changes, as {day, period, key} - "key": "" clears that period (makes it free that day). Only list a cell here if the class it should now hold is different from what the context below already shows there. Moving a class is two entries (clear its old cell, set its new one); swapping two classes is two entries (each cell gets the other's key).
- "bellTimes"/"breakTimes"/"countdownEvents"/"reverseWeek": each has a matching *Changed boolean (see above). When the instruction adds, removes, or edits ANY period/break/event/the odd-even split, set that one flag true and give the COMPLETE new value of that whole field, in order (not a partial patch within it) - e.g. adding one bell period still means the complete "bellTimes" array including the new one; adding one break time still means the complete "breakTimes" array including the new one, and so on. "bellTimes" is the list of [start, end] 24-hour time strings ("HH:MM"), one per period, in the same order "scheduleEdits"' period numbers use. Adding a period means appending a new [start, end] pair; removing or reordering a period shifts every later period's index - when that happens, also add "scheduleEdits" entries for whatever classes sat in those later periods, moving each to its new index (and clearing its old one), so nothing silently ends up in the wrong period. "breakTimes" is named special/break times (e.g. 午休, 打掃時間, 就寢時間) as {name, start, end} - independent of "bellTimes"/the schedule, not tied to any period index. "countdownEvents" is named date-range events (e.g. 段考, 校慶) as {name, startDate, endDate} ("YYYY-MM-DD" each, the same day for a single-day event).

單雙週分堂課 (odd/even-week split classes): ONE class entry can alternate between two different subject/teacher pairs depending on whether the real-world week is 單週 (odd) or 雙週 (even) - this is a single "classUpserts" entry (never two, and never two "scheduleEdits" cells) whose "subject" and/or "teacher" string is written as "單週內容/雙週內容", the two halves joined by a "/" (a full-width "／" means the same thing - normalize it to "/"). Example: {"subject": "國文/公民", "teacher": "李老師/陳老師"} is one slot that shows 國文 taught by 李老師 on 單週 weeks and 公民 taught by 陳老師 on 雙週 weeks; "location" is never split this way, it's the same room either week. Recognizing, creating, and editing these:
  - An existing class already has this split if its subject or teacher (in the context below) contains "/". The part before "/" is what shows on 單週, the part after is 雙週.
  - To turn an existing single-subject class into a split one (e.g. "週三第二節國文，改成單週上國文、雙週上公民" or "幫我把這堂課弄成單雙週，雙週改成地理" where only one side is named and the other should stay what it already was), add ONE "classUpserts" entry reusing that class's existing key, joining the 單週 content and 雙週 content with "/" in whichever of subject/teacher actually alternates - leave the other field its existing plain unsplit value if it doesn't alternate (e.g. same teacher both weeks).
  - To create a brand-new split class from scratch (e.g. "新增一節課，單週英文王老師、雙週美術林老師"), it works exactly like creating any new course (see "classUpserts" above), just with "/"-joined subject/teacher instead of plain ones.
  - To edit only one side of an already-split class (e.g. "雙週那半改成地理" or "單週的公民老師換成陳老師"), the "classUpserts" entry's untouched side must repeat that side's text exactly as it already was in context, only the named side actually changes - this is still "only change what's asked", just scoped to half of one field inside one entry rather than the whole field.
  - To un-split one back into a single subject/teacher for every week (e.g. "OO老師的課取消單雙週，都固定上物理"), the "classUpserts" entry replaces the whole "/"-joined string with the one value that now applies always.

Day numbering: 0 = 週日, 1 = 週一, 2 = 週二, 3 = 週三, 4 = 週四, 5 = 週五, 6 = 週六 (matches JavaScript's Date.getDay(), the same numbering the context's own weeklySchedule keys use).
Period numbering: 0-based, matching the index into a weeklySchedule day array and into bellTimes (period 0 is 第一節, period 1 is 第二節, and so on).
Numbers may be Chinese or Arabic, and several periods may be packed together ("二三節", "2、3節", "二到四節" all mean more than one period); always pick the reading where every day/period actually exists in the context.

Read the instruction the way a colleague would, not a compiler: it may be indirect, colloquial, or point at its target through context instead of naming it outright - e.g. "把國文課挪到早自習後面" means move it to whichever period immediately follows whatever's named/labeled 早自習 in the given context; "這兩堂對調" without the word "交換" still means swap them; "把雙週那半改掉" implicitly means the class in question already has a 單/雙週 split (see above) and only that half changes. Work out the concrete edit a reasonable teacher would mean from the wording and the context you were given, rather than requiring the instruction to spell out mechanics literally. This reasoning is about READING the instruction, not about inventing content: still never invent a day, period, subject, teacher, location, time, or event that neither the instruction nor the given context actually supports.

Decide "status":
- "ok": the instruction maps cleanly onto a change (or several - see below) to the data below, using only days/periods/classes/times that make sense given the context (and, for a multi-part instruction, given the effect of any earlier part already applied - e.g. moving a class out of a slot and then putting a different class into that now-empty slot is a perfectly ordinary two-part instruction, not a conflict). Fill in only whichever of "classUpserts"/"deletedClassKeys"/"scheduleEdits"/the four *Changed fields the patch actually needs - leave every other field/flag empty/false.
- "unclear": after actually reasoning through the wording and context as above, the instruction (or any part of it, if it describes several changes) still has multiple equally plausible readings with nothing to prefer one over another, is contradictory, or does not describe an edit to this data at all. This is not the same as "phrased indirectly" - reserve "unclear" for genuine ambiguity, not for instructions that merely require a little inference to resolve. Leave every field/flag empty/false (i.e. no actual change). Briefly explain why in "reason" (Traditional Chinese, one short sentence).
- "not_found": the instruction is clear about what it wants, but names a day, period, class, break time, or countdown event that does not exist in the given context at the point it's referenced. Leave every field/flag empty/false. Briefly explain in "reason" (Traditional Chinese, one short sentence).

A single instruction may describe more than one distinct change (e.g. joined by "而且"/"然後"/"，"/"、", or a numbered/bulleted list) - apply all of them together in the one result you return (e.g. several "scheduleEdits" entries, or a "classUpserts" entry alongside a "scheduleEdits" entry), same as if each had been requested separately in order. If any one part is ambiguous or refers to something that doesn't exist, treat the WHOLE instruction as "unclear"/"not_found" rather than silently applying only the parts that made sense.

Return ONLY the raw JSON object — no markdown fences, no comments, no extra text.

The current data, given as read-only context so you know what already exists and can decide what to change - do NOT copy any of it back into your result, only refer to it by key/day/period:
${JSON.stringify(context)}

The instruction to translate: "${text}"`;
