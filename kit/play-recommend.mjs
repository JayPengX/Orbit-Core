// Quadra Play's recommendations (the tag on a pick: value, steady, shot), in the shared kit: Play's phone and the Worker's board (builders/play.js) tag from this one copy.
// Recommendations, shown on each pick rather than in a separate list. Every
// pick is judged by the same number the whole page uses, its average back per
// NT$100 (its chance of winning x the lottery's odds), against the other
// picks on offer. The simulated crowd's value hunters pick from the same
// recommendations, so both sides see the same "good" bets.
//
// A pick gets at most one tag, first that fits:
// - value 划算: among the best returns of the lot (top 10%);
// - steady 穩: likely to win (65% or more) and returns at least the median;
// - shot 值博: a long shot (30% or less) whose return is in the top quarter.
// Locked picks (the house won't sell them) never get one, nor near-certain
// picks (over 85%: their return looks good only because the house can't
// price them under 1.01) or near-hopeless ones (under 5%), nor a lot too
// small to compare (under 10 picks).
