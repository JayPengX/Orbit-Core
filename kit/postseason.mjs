// MLB's postseason as MLB itself has it (statsapi.mlb.com, one small read
// for the whole October): every game still possible, whether its time is
// set, and whether it's "If Necessary". ESPN's are copies of MLB's that
// lag, and an app built them from day pages read at different times (the
// nightly pack, a day read live), so one series could show G4 待定, G5
// timed and G6 待定 again. MLB's one answer is a single moment for every
// game: the apps take each playoff game's time, 待定 and 如需 from it, and
// a game MLB no longer lists (its series over) is gone.
//
// Loaded by the apps with import('#kit/postseason.mjs').catch(() => null):
// an older kit without this file leaves them as before.
