# Handoff: Quadra, work in progress

> **2026-10-12:** Shared-Data's season archive (caught up and live; what was fixed and what's open: §2) and Quadra Play's move to the proxy (stages 1–3 done: the Worker settles slips; the odds calculation's move waits on the owner's choice): `docs/HANDOFF-2026-10-12.md`.

All repos develop on a session branch (lately `claude/happy-wright-eqzr16`) and are pushed to
`main` after every change (each deploys on push). The shared kit lives in
`Shared-Proxy/kit/` and is served to every app from Shared-Proxy's Pages
(see the rebrand below). Tests: `npm test` in each repo (Orbit Class also
`npx eslint .`).



## Shared-Data onto Cloudflare: R2, the builders in the proxy, read on demand (2026-10-13/14, pushed to `main`)

The owner: move Shared-Data to Cloudflare (keeping the $5 plan), copy the
existing files rather than reading them again, ultra efficient, "some can be
read per user request", and remove the repo.
- **R2** (`quadra-data`, Asia-Pacific; the owner turned R2 on): `/data/<path>`
  (`data.js`: edge cache in Taiwan → R2 → Shared-Data's Pages copy while
  moving). The last GitHub build copied in as it was (Shared-Data's
  `r2sync.mjs`, run "r2": the Pages artifact, no source read). The kit's
  `packJson` and Transit's packs read `/data/` (phones' saved copies kept:
  the kit keys under the old Pages address, Transit by name).
- **Read on demand** (`sports.js`): a read over for good (a completed game,
  a day or month all completed, a past Asian month) kept in R2 the first time
  anyone reads it, served from there for good. The nightly mirror (37,000
  copies rewritten each night: ~1.1M R2 writes a month, past R2's free 1M)
  isn't ported. Mirror reads go through the proxy's batches (`fromMirror`),
  not a request each.
- **The builders** in the proxy's hourly cron (`builders/run.js`, §4.7 of
  the README): watch (hourly light, daily full), winprob (daily, Polymarket
  through the proxy's trimmed cache), CPBL tables and whole months (TheSportsDB
  day by day: cpbl.com.tw answers no server, Taiwan's included), season packs
  (only unsettled months), photo lists (four a day in turn), cutouts (20 an
  hour), buses (a city a week, TDX in small pages for the Worker's memory).
  Orbit Sports' broadcast, highlights and win probability moved into the kit
  (`kit/sports-*.mjs`) so the builders run the app's own code.
- **The guard** counts R2 too (10 GB, 1M Class A, 10M Class B; unknown
  operations as Class A). Fixed on the way: its cron never ran (every proxy
  push redeployed it: `deploy-guard.yml` now, only its own files); its entry
  exported constants (`guard-worker.js`). `tail.yml` reads any Worker's logs.
- **Shared-Data**: everything removed but the bus builders' workflow, then
  that too once the copy's confirmed; the repo's deletion waits on the
  owner's yes (it can't be undone; its Pages site goes with it).
- Phones: highlights searched on the phone only in a game's first hours
  (the hourly pack has the rest); one connection, not two.
- Checked: npm test (Shared-Proxy 287, Shared-Data 5), dry runs, live: the
  merged route, `/data/` answering, the F1 log. Not yet seen: the first
  hourly builders' run on Cloudflare (16:17 UTC), the guard's first reading.

## One proxy for everything (2026-10-13, pushed to `main`)

The owner: "one proxy for all … organize it so it's not two independent
things in one proxy". The data proxy was its own Worker only because the
main one was pinned to Virginia for Gemini; pinned to Taiwan now, where the
people are, it moved in as a route like the others:
- `sports.js` (was `sports-proxy-worker.js`): `handleSports` (the route) and
  `sportsCron` (the F1 lap log's minute), routed by `worker.js` beside
  /eco, /play, /transit, /weather; `http.js` holds the CORS and JSON answers
  every route uses (the sports copy of them is gone); the developer settings
  read in place from `/config`'s cached copy (`useDevSettings`), no service
  binding; Play's price check calls the route in place (no SPORTS binding).
- `wrangler.toml`: the F1Log Durable Object (new class, `f1-log-main`; the
  old Worker's fortnight of laps not carried: F1's archive has those
  sessions), the minute cron Thursday–Monday, `SPORTS_DEV`.
- `sports-proxy` is now `sports-forward.js`: hands every request to the
  proxy over a service binding, for phones on a kit from before the move;
  its class deleted (`f1-log-2`), no crons. **Remove it** once its Workers
  Logs show no requests for a week (README §4.1 lists what goes with it).
- The kit (`PROXY_URL` in `quadra.mjs`, `play-sources.mjs`), Securities'
  `quotes.mjs`, Shared-Data's `watch.mjs`/`asia.mjs` (and its imports of
  `sports.js`) point at `orbit-workers-proxy…/sports-proxy`; the apps'
  second preconnect is gone (one connection, not two). Phones' saved copies
  are keyed by the source's URL, so nothing opens cold.
- Pushed in order: the Worker, checked live through the dev door, then the
  kit and apps.

## Cloudflare on the $5 plan, with a hard stop on the bill (2026-10-13, pushed to `main`)

The owner moved Cloudflare to Workers Paid ($5) and asked for a hard limit:
"not a penny more". Cloudflare has no spending cap (budget alerts only
email; checked in its billing docs), so:
- **`guard.js`, Worker `quota-guard`** (`wrangler.guard.toml`, cron every
  5 min, no address): reads the period's use from Cloudflare's GraphQL
  analytics (Workers requests and CPU, KV reads/writes/deletes/lists and
  storage, Durable Objects requests and storage) and at 90% of any of the
  plan's included amounts turns both proxies' workers.dev addresses off and
  empties their crons, until the next period (then puts both back). Blind
  6 h while armed: stops too. `deploy.yml` deploys it and re-applies a stop
  after any deploy.
- Each toml: `[limits] cpu_ms` (3,000 main, 1,000 sports and guard) and
  Workers Logs sampling (0.25 main, 0.05 sports: the logs' 20M events can't
  be reached even at the plan's 10M requests).
- `capacity.js`: the day's budget is the plan's (290,000: 9M over 31 days),
  not the free plan's 100,000. The admin page's 容量 shows the real bill per
  count, so far and at this pace, and whether the proxies are stopped.
- Merging the two proxies (the owner asked): done the same day, above.
- Checked: 10 new tests (`tests/guard.test.mjs`), `npm test` 234/234,
  `wrangler deploy --dry-run` of all three tomls. **Not yet armed**: needs
  the owner's `CF_GUARD_TOKEN` (README §11, four steps); until then it
  says "unarmed" on 容量 and nothing stops a bill. The GraphQL field
  `cpuTimeUs` is unconfirmed in Cloudflare's docs: the guard falls back to
  requests × P99 CPU (an overcount) if the API refuses it; check 容量's CPU
  line after arming.
- Workers Logs moves to "Cloudflare Observability pricing" on 2026-12-01:
  look again then.

## Transit: YouBike by the walk there on the streets (2026-10-13, pushed to `main`)

The owner, by 新竹縣體育場: the plan walked them 670 m to 成功國中 and back
(its walk said 4′, the straight line's guess). Stations were chosen by the
straight line; the stadium's block is in the way. Now the planner asks the
walks from each end to its five nearest stations before choosing
(`planner streetWalks`, `plan.mjs useStreetWalks`), and the walks it builds
take them. With real walks alone it took 光明九路停車場 (511 m) to save some
riding (the owner's 竹東 rule): in a station's choice a walk past 5 minutes
now counts double. Live: 新竹縣體育場 151 m, 成功國中 489, 光明九路 511.

A walk is now the shorter of Google's and OpenStreetMap's (`api walksTo`;
OpenStreetMap's table, one ask, its snapping metres added back): a router
misses paths, never makes one up (Google 210 to 成功國中 where OSM went 485;
OSM 419 into 縣體育場 where Google went 748 to an entrance). OSM's free
server sometimes stalls (8 s): then Google's, kept, so walks still agree.

Batch (22 trips, the code before against this, at one moment): every trip
into 縣體育場 walks 5′ at the end (3′ was the straight line into the grounds);
竹中站 → 巨城 leaves the bike at 遠東巨城 (SOGO before); 高鐵新竹 → 清大 one
plan 走2′ → 走6′ (both routers miss the indoor walkway to 六家's YouBike:
624 m); the rest a minute's walk either way. Verdicts unchanged.

## Transit: Apple Maps for a walk or a ride; search a chain nearest first (2026-10-13, pushed to `main`)

The owner: Apple Maps beside Google for a walk or a ride, chosen in 我的 →
交通偏好 → 導航 App (`prefs.maps`, `nav.mjs mapsLink / appleMapsLink`:
maps.apple.com/directions, walking or cycling; Google's travelmode walking or
bicycling). Never for a bus or train (the owner: the app's own plan; a link
carries only the destination, so Google or Apple would plan their own): ⋯'s
用 Google 地圖導航 (the whole trip by transit) removed. Not tried on a phone:
Apple's directions URL needs a recent iOS.

Then (the owner): Google's walking started navigating at once (cycling
showed the route first): `dir_action=navigate` dropped, both open to look
over. And a walk looked ahead to started from where you were: a step that
isn't the one you've reached (`state.reached`), or a plan's, now starts at
its own start (Google `origin`, Apple `source`). Checked in the preview: the
step you're at has no origin; a bike step ahead starts at its station.

Search: 八分雲集 from 成功九街 gave 八方雲集 in other cities and not every one
near. Autocomplete (five at most) now beside Text Search (20, relevant, near
you first, a typo still found; kept a day for the same words within ~1 km,
the textSearch cap), ranked by `nearFirst`: every place within 25 km
nearest first (the name typed whole first), the same chain's branches
beyond 25 km left out while one's near (a chain: its name before the
branch), then the rest. Tested on the owner's case with made-up answers;
not seen with Google here (no key).

Then (the owner): LaLaport should be LaLaport, not its cinema or car parks,
reliably. `folded`: results carrying the words typed, within 400 m of a
whole place by Google's own type (mall, department store, station, airport,
university, hospital, stadium, amusement park, zoo, museum), that are
plainly its parts (a car park, cinema, shop, somewhere to eat… by type, or
the whole place's name in theirs) fold into it. Nothing folds without a
whole place (two 八方雲集 stay two), a shop asked by its own name stays
(鼎泰豐 LaLaport), and a place of its own beside one stays (新竹轉運站 by
新竹車站). Tested on those cases; not seen with Google here.

## Transit: one walk everywhere, Google's; the loading screen onto a finished map (2026-10-13, pushed to `main`)

The owner: the planner's 210 m to 成功國中 was right (Google says 210);
OpenStreetMap's router went round the block (485). So the last change
(a planner's walk by its line, `walksByLine`) was taken out the same round,
and every walk is one walk, Google's: Shared-Proxy `/transit/walk` (the
route matrix, an element each, `matrix` cap 9,000; with `line=1` Compute
Routes, the `routes` cap; each walk kept a month in the Worker's cache),
OpenStreetMap's router past the cap. The app (`api.mjs walksTo`, kept on
the phone) for the strip, a card's 距離 and 走過去, the walk it starts, a
trip's own walks and a walk-only trip from where you are; from where it
was last asked until you're 20 m on, so all agree; the strip not asked while
hidden. Not seen with Google here (the preview has no key: OpenStreetMap's).

The strip reshuffled on every open (straight-line order, then the streets'),
and things came in after the loading screen. Now the map tab's `ready` holds
it (app.mjs, 4 s at most): a fresh fix (1.5 s), the tiles (1.5 s), what's in
view and the strip, drawn once in its order. Measured in the preview at 120
ms latency (`--shuffle` now sees Transit's markers and strip): before, the
loading screen went at 1.4 s onto an empty map; now nothing moves after it,
at 2.6–3.0 s, of which the tiles ~1.3 s (one NLSC tile takes 0.8–1.1 s to
reach this container; a phone in Taiwan ~0.1–0.2 s). Sped up: the map's
library asked by the page itself (0.3 s, was 1.4 s), its tiles' servers
connected at once, the layers asked beside the tiles, no 台北車站 tiles on a
first open. Not measured on a phone: ask the owner how it opens.

## Transit: YouBike from a station with a bike; walks by the streets (2026-10-13, pushed to `main`)

The owner: a trip starting with the bike shouldn't send you to a station
empty as you plan (first asked for every rent, then taken back: only a trip
that starts with it, the counts change by the time a later one comes;
nothing else moves by itself). `rentNear({ first })` from `bikeOnly`,
`bikeToRail`, a planner's first bike and 騎 YouBike on a card; off a train,
`bikeFromRail`, still by place (yesterday's call otherwise stands: TRUTH
§15). The verdicts unchanged. Not run: the live batch (`live.mjs --against`),
stopped by the owner.

And walking distances by the streets: the strip of nearest stations asks
OpenStreetMap's foot router (free) for each of the five, nearest that way
first (新竹火車站(後站) 200 m → 570 m round the tracks; seen in the preview);
a trip's walks we add take the router's length, and its 步行 with them
(the router was already asked, for the line).

Then (the owner): the walk didn't match: the strip by the streets, the
station's card (距離, 走過去 · N 分) still the straight line. Now one walk
for all (`walkFrom`: the strip, a card's 距離 and 走過去, the walk it starts);
seen in the preview: 新竹火車站(後站) 8 分 · 570 公尺 on all three. The pace
is still 75 m a minute (4.5 km/h, `WALK_M_MIN`; Google's is nearer 5 km/h):
asked the owner.

The owner: Google's pace, then. `WALK_M_MIN` 83 (5 km/h) everywhere it's
used (planning, navigation's times, the strip and cards, a change between
stations, `rail.mjs`); the slow-going penalty stays past 375 m (it was fitted
in metres: moved with the pace, 竹東's verdict, 竹東信義立體停車場 not 客運竹東站
8 minutes on, flipped). One made-up test moved (470 m, not 400, for "only
just" at the new pace). Verdicts unchanged. Not run: the live batch.

Then (the owner, a walk from home to 成功國中's station): the strip 6 分 ·
510 公尺, the trip 3 分 · 210 公尺, its line round the block. The trip was
TDX's: its walk came with a line but no length (the proxy's straight guess,
×1.3) and a time to match the guess. A planner's walk now takes its line's
length when that's clearly longer, and the time to walk it (`walksByLine`,
before `tidy`; first walk out earlier, last in later, one between rides
within the gap). Tested (the owner's block); not seen on screen (the preview
has no TDX planner).

## Transit: the YouBike return station on the map, navigating (2026-10-13, pushed to `main`)

The owner, riding 臺鐵竹中車站 → 綠41公園: no mark where the bike goes back.
Navigating turns the map's bike stations off, and the way marked only each
ride's start. Now a bike ride's end is marked too, a bike in the ride's
colour (`tab-map bikeReturns`; a swap every 30 minutes, returned and rented
at one station, marked once). Tested; not seen on screen (the preview's
made-up network planned no bike trip): ask the owner.

Then (the owner): a mark is to show exactly where the station is, as a bus
stop's does. Both stations (take and return) are now the map's own YouBike
marker, its tip on the station, its bikes and ⚡ (`planBikes`, from the plan's
own stations), in place of the round mark; the trip view's live bike layer
for its ends is gone (the plan layer has them, navigating too). Seen in the
preview on a trip to 東區 (both stations, tips on them); navigation draws the
same plan layer (not started in the preview).

Then (the owner): where you take one, its bikes; where it goes back, its
docks; a swap both. Each station's marker now says what you need there,
labelled (then the owner: no Chinese on the marker, it's ugly; so the bikes
as the map's own, 🚲 5 ⚡2, the docks a blue parking P, P 19, a swap P 19 |
🚲 5; seen in the preview; then: the blue P too loud, so it's outlined in the marker's own ink, like its bike; then: the letter sat off-centre in its box (a font's glyph), so it's an icon, `ui.mjs dock`, drawn centred) (`planBikeMarker`), coloured by
the scarcer of the two (no docks to return to: grey), from the city's live
bikes once they're in (the plan's own counts first). Seen in the preview
(借 6 ⚡2, 還 22); a swap needs a ride over 30 minutes, not reached there
(tested).

## Transit: pinned places on the map (2026-10-13, pushed to `main`)

The owner asked to see their pinned places on the map. Each one (家, 學校…)
is now a marker at every zoom: its icon in a white-ringed disc and its name
(`tab-map placeMarker`, layer `places`, drawn with the chips so a change in
我的 shows at once; hidden while navigating, like the other layers). A tap
opens the place's card (路線, 已釘選), the marker itself selected; its chip
selects it too. Help text and README updated. Checked in the preview
(Chromium at 375 px: WebKit isn't installed in this container): both pins
drawn, a tap opens 家's card.

## Transit: pinned places on the map (2026-10-13, pushed to `main`)

The owner asked to see their pinned places on the map. Each one (家, 學校…)
is now a marker at every zoom: its icon in a white-ringed disc and its name
(`tab-map placeMarker`, layer `places`, drawn with the chips so a change in
我的 shows at once; hidden while navigating, like the other layers). A tap
opens the place's card (路線, 已釘選), the marker itself selected; its chip
selects it too. Help text and README updated. Checked in the preview
(Chromium at 375 px: WebKit isn't installed in this container): both pins
drawn, a tap opens 家's card. Not yet seen on a phone.

Then (the owner): a place pinned from one of Google's showed twice on Google's
map. Google's map can't hide one place (only whole kinds), so the owner chose
to cover it: the pin is at Google's own spot for the place (its details'
lat/lon) and the name is now on a solid label tucked under the disc, over
Google's name beside its icon. Google places its label left, right or below
by itself, so some may still show: not checkable here (the preview has no
Google key, NLSC only); ask the owner how it looks.

## Transit: the owner's list of 2026-10-13 morning, five items (pushed to `main`)

1. **編輯行程 while navigating** (⋯; replaces 先去別的地方 and 改目的地): the
   places still to go, each changed with a tap or taken off with ×, a stop
   added first or last. A change to where you're heading first re-routes (on
   a bus or train staying on it, `onBoardTo`); one to the places after it only
   changes the list (`navRetarget`, now saved). Checked in the preview (a
   later stop taken off on the 5608).
2. **Stayed on past your stop**: navigation took you as off (near the stop)
   but you go on along the ride's way 300 m and more past it, within 6
   minutes: back on it, off at the next stop, the rest from there
   (`state.passed`, tab-map `stayedOn`). Not checkable in the preview (no
   live movement along a real route): ask the owner.
3. **Stops on the line**, navigating: every ride's stops are loaded when it
   starts (`navStops`) and drawn as dots, where you get off ringed; the metro
   now has stops too (`metro.mjs metroStops`: its line's stations between the
   two ends, either way). Checked live in the preview: 區間 1806 新竹 → 竹東 (7)
   and the 5608 (27).
4. **常用行程**: a trip saved from where you were had no start (planned from
   wherever you are, no way back): now that spot is kept, named after a place
   of yours within 300 m; 編輯行程 (saved trips) has rows to change either end
   (start can still be 目前位置). The way back once you're in the far end's
   part (its last 30%, nearer it): at 竹東 station on 成功九街 → 竹東高中. From
   the trip's own start except within 800 m of it. **The owner's own trip may
   have been saved with no start: set it to 成功九街 in 我的 → 行程.**
5. **Navigation ended on coming back**: it ended at 5 minutes past the
   planned arrival (`savedNav`, `onShow`), and a resumed ride past it opened as
   a plan (`showPlan` asked `canNav`). Now kept 90 minutes past (it ends by
   itself when you get there), and a resumed ride always navigates.

## Transit: done steps can't be tapped (2026-10-13, pushed to `main`)

The owner tapped a faded (done) step chip and was taken back to it, the map
too. The chips behind you are now disabled (no `data-nav-go`, `pointer-events:
none`, and `go` refuses a step behind you). Checked in the preview.


Then (the owner, the same evening): tapping a step ahead locked every step
before it. The lock is now by how far the trip has got by itself
(`state.reached`: where you are, an arrival, getting off, staying on, the
start; kept when it's opened again), never by a tap: a step only looked
ahead past stays tappable. Checked in the preview on an eight-step trip:
a tap to 4 leaves 0–3 tappable, back to 2 works; walked to the end of the
first step, 0 locks.
## Transit: waiting for the bus, the street itself (2026-10-13, pushed to `main`)

The owner: the stop's close-up wasn't close enough to see which side of the
road the stop is on. Waiting, `stageView` now frames ~100 m across (was ~400),
wider only to have you in it too. Checked in the preview at 文興嘉興路口.

## Transit: navigation's cards fold for more map (2026-10-13, pushed to `main`)

The owner: the map between the two cards was too small. Each card has a grip
(the plan card's look): a tap, or a swipe (top up, bottom down), folds it;
folded, the top is its step and the line under it, the bottom the arrival
row, ⋯ and 結束; kept on the device (`ot.nav.fold`). Found on the way: the map
was fitted before the cards were drawn and not again until you moved (on
board, the stops coming in made the top card taller and you ended under it);
now each draw compares the cards' heights and the map fits again when they
change (`nav.mjs` → `cards` → `tab-map navView`). Checked in the preview at
375 px: open and both folded, you between the cards each time.
- **A slip:** the English 說明 line had a straight apostrophe ("card's") in a
  single-quoted string: `kit/help.mjs` didn't load (the Pass sheet's `pass.mjs`
  imports it, in every app). Pushed in c3c5101 with the test run's one failure
  unread; fixed 46 s later (8597428). Run `npm test` and read it before every
  kit push; write ’ in the 說明's English.

## Transit: a stop added on board keeps the ride (2026-10-13, pushed to `main`)

The owner: 先去別的地方 while navigating started a new plan from here, no use
on a bus. Now, on a bus or train, 先去別的地方 and 改目的地 change the trip in
place (`tab-map.mjs onBoardTo`): off at the ride's stop nearest the new place
or the one you had, whichever gets there sooner (each planned with
`restFrom`), the rest from there (`nav.mjs navChangeOff` / `navRest`), the
destination and the places after it updated (`navRetarget`; once there, on to
the old destination as with any stop). Walking, riding or waiting: still the
ways from here. Checked in the preview (5608, its stops not known there: kept
on it to 竹東站, then to 清大, 竹東高中 next). A first try called a helper
that only exists in nav.mjs (caught in the preview; files checked for
undefined names with eslint's no-undef).

## Transit: 「好像已經下車了？」 on board, on the route (2026-10-13, pushed to `main`)

The owner, on the 快捷8號支 by 高鐵新竹站, was asked if they'd got off. Cause:
"off the ride" was measured from the straight lines between its stops, and
the route loops round 高鐵新竹站 on roads 250 m and more from them; two fixes
were enough to ask. Now it's the nearer of those lines and the ride's road as
drawn on the map (`navlive.mjs offRide`), and it asks only after 45 s off.
Test on a made-up loop; not yet checked on a phone.

## Transit: navigation, the owner's second note of 2026-10-13 (pushed to `main`)

1. Waiting for the bus: the map stays close up on you and the stop (not out
   to where the ride goes) until the ride has you on board.
2. The bus countdown jumped back to 4 minutes on each refresh. Cause: an
   estimate was counted from when it reached the phone, but TDX makes one
   about a minute (Hsinchu County: "389 s" unchanged for over a minute, its
   `DataTime` 70 s old when read) and the proxy keeps it 25–60 s. Now every
   estimate counts from its `DataTime` (`util.mjs etaAge`: the navigation
   countdown via `live.mjs liveTimes`, stops' rows via `bus.mjs etaOf`, and
   the Worker's bus alerts in `push.js`); the ETA asks now `$select` it. Bus
   positions weren't needed for this; the countdown runs on, moved only when
   TDX's estimate itself moves.
3. A saved trip tapped in 交通 while navigating put its plan card over the
   navigation card: `showPlan` now shrinks navigation to its bar first (as a
   new search did already). Seen in the preview, old and new.
4. Back in the app after a while, the map zoomed out to the whole island: a
   fit made before the page had its size (or with the cards taller than the
   map) has no room and zooms out fully. `map.mjs fit` now skips a fit with no
   room (returns false), navigation tries again in a moment, and does the
   stage's fit again 350 ms after coming back. Not reproducible in the
   preview; ask the owner whether it still happens.

## Transit: navigation's map by stage, the line under the step whole (2026-10-13, pushed to `main`)

From the owner's screenshot (on the bike to 陽明交通大學(六家校區)):
- The line under the step ("文興嘉興路口 06:43 到站・早…") was cut with an
  ellipsis: it now goes on to a second line between its parts (`・`), never
  cut (TRUTH §10).
- The map kept the whole rest of the trip in view at every step, too far out
  on a walk or a short ride; it now shows the stage you're at (`nav.mjs
  stageView`): walking or riding, you and the rest of that step to where the
  next starts (never under ~400 m across); waiting, the stop and where the
  ride goes; on board, the rest of the ride to your stop. The kit's 說明 says so.
- `scripts/navstate.mjs wenxing` previews the owner's trip. Checked in the
  preview at 375 px in Chromium (no WebKit in the cloud box): the line whole on
  two lines, the bike stage close up, waiting and on board framed to the ride.
  Not yet on a phone. (The screenshot, 06:31, still showed 成功國中: it was
  taken before the station fix below went out at 06:45.)

## Transit: the YouBike station behind you (2026-10-13, pushed to `main`)

The owner: 成功九街 → 竹東高中, the ride to the bus at 文興嘉興路口 started at
成功國中, not 綠41公園 ("more smooth"). Cause: the station was picked by walk
plus ride time only, so from the north half of 成功九街 (成功國中 ~90 m behind,
綠41公園 ~220 m on the way) going back past the door was ~50 s "quicker".
Now (`plan.mjs bestStation`) a station behind you counts the ground walked
out and ridden back as lost twice at walking pace, and a walk past 5 minutes
is slow going as in the score (`slowWalk`, one rule for both): 綠41公園 from
the whole street but its west end at 成功國中's door; the ride to 六家 too;
竹東街上 keeps its 2-minute station (a first try sent it on an 8-minute walk).
Also: the 快捷8號支 way that ends by bike (off at 台北榮總) walked 16 minutes
to 文興嘉興路口 while a bike to the stop was there: a change gone at the end
now also gets the bike to the first bus (`withBikes`). Verdict
`chenggong-zhudonghs-0645`; the trip is in `live.mjs`'s batch (成功九街北).
Batch (22 trips, old against new): the station moves on the same rule (新竹站
→ 清大 from 新竹轉運站, on the way; 巨城 left at SOGO, before it; 成功九街北),
竹東站 → 縣體育場 by bike to the 快捷8號支 at 竹東 and on by bike from
文興嘉興路口 (3 min sooner); the rest live data (each re-run alone).

## Transit: the owner's navigation and planning list of 2026-10-12 evening (pushed to `main`)

1. A tap on the map while navigating closed the trip's card (its way went
   off the map) and a second tap dropped a pin card over it: taps, marker
   taps and Google's places open nothing while navigating (a tap pauses the
   map's following like a drag).
2. The whole trip shown while navigating: every step in its colours (the
   one you're on boldest, behind you faint), the rest of the trip from you
   kept in view (was: the street around you at the step's scale); every
   step chip whole at the bottom (wrapping; was a sideways row cut at the
   edge). The pace line shortened so it never cuts (「早到 5 分」).
3. and 5. Steps move on by where you are (`nav.mjs tripAt`): the next
   step's way under you catches an end a fix skipped; on a bus or train
   once its first stop is behind you; a train's station counts within
   250 m. Started (or reopened) half way, it begins at your step.
4. 竹東高中 → 成功九街 (the owner's trip at 16:35, replayed):
   - the router boarded the 六家 train 1758 at 新莊 (the first stop it could
     be reached, riding 1831 past 竹中 and back): a change is now made at the
     first station where the next train already calls (`rail.mjs earliest`);
   - "1831 to 竹中 and ride" was dropped as "the same train" as "1831 to
     千甲 and ride": the same train left a kilometre or more apart is now two
     ways (`sameWay`);
   - the owner's calls in the same round: **no bridge penalty** (rivers are
     only the way round to a bridge, in the ride's time); **no live YouBike
     counts in planning** (stations by place; every station is 2.0, 電輔車
     anywhere; navigation offers 「這站沒車／還車站沒位，換附近的站」 as a tap,
     never moving the ride by itself); rides' road length no longer counts
     the way to a bridge twice (OSRM: 竹中 → 綠41公園 5.3 km, ours was 6.1);
   - new set-aside rules: over the river on the bike before/after a train
     when a train over it is within 15 min (新竹站 → 成功九街: 竹北 train or
     快捷9號, not 千甲 + 經國大橋); the same train stayed on for nothing (on to
     千甲 when off at 竹中 is home first; on to 北新竹 or 新竹 and back up to 竹北
     when the 六家線 is home first); "beaten" only by the same rides
     (北新竹 → 竹北 no longer beats 竹中 → 六家); a folded plan folds nothing.
   - Result: 竹東高中 ★ 1831 → 竹中 → 1758 → 六家; 新竹站 ★ 竹北 train, 快捷9號.
   Batch (21 trips, old against new): 17 changed, read one by one (Orbit-Transit bd91642).
- **Ranking rewritten (pushed):** shown-or-folded by comparisons on bother, never a total a point lower; folded ways fold nothing; the owner's verdicts as real-trip tests (`tests/verdicts/`, `scripts/verdict.mjs`), checked again with buses a few minutes off. Add every trip the owner judges. Also: a picked time is per trip; buses caught from when you set out (catchBus); 改搭別班 and missed-it in navigation; a bus between stops on the route sheet.
- **To be there by a time (pushed):** 成功九街 → 竹東高中 by 08:00 showed two buses only. Now also the 六家線 to 竹中 and on to 竹東 (our trains searched from two hours before the time; the planners leave it out) and riding it all on two bikes (timed to get in by then; never folded as far behind; 每 30 分鐘換車 always on for a TPASS with YouBike). The same last train from another first one is folded (竹北 and a change at 北新竹 for the 1804). Verdict `chenggong-zhudonghs-arrive0800`; `scripts/verdict.mjs --arrive ISO --tpass id`.
- **Missed the bus, still on time; no bike (pushed):** navigation keeps a by-a-time trip's deadline (`plan.deadline`): late for the bus, or the next one too late, it plans from where you are for the same time and offers the best on-time way on the card (one tap swaps; nav.mjs `lateBy`/`onTimeWay`, tab-map `navLate`); 換一條路 plans by it too. By a time, the planner now also runs its second round (bus to the station, train then bus, direct buses) from two hours back; a walk over 2 km to a ride folds while there's another way; sooner-there is no merit by a time; a saved by-a-time trip whose set-out time has gone is planned again. Verdict `chenggong-zhudonghs-arrive0800-nobike`; `scripts/navstate.mjs late` previews the offer.

## The owner's second list of 2026-10-11 (pushed to `main`)

- **Admin:** 金流 (money.js: every account's 真相 summed, the system's net,
  Quadra's take by sport and fee, players' markets; a deleted account's worth
  back to the system, `quadra-config/ledger`); 容量 in 開發 (capacity.js:
  people this week and in 30 days, each free plan against them, and
  依人數自動調整 slowing the live refreshes together, checked every 6 hours,
  the owner's numbers the floor).
- **Kit:** pressed only when pressed (every `:active` becomes
  `[data-q-press]` on a touch device, set after 90 ms or on a tap, never while
  scrolling); postseason's If Necessary games 待定 until the game before is over.
- **Play:** 不計入 crossed out in red; 勝分差 a row per team; 雙重機會 主勝或和;
  the markets keep their tallest height while a game is open.
- **Securities:** 今日 only while a market held trades (週五 on a weekend);
  NT$ prices with two decimals; the movers named for their day.
- **Weather:** an old forecast says so (更新中 · 2 小時前的資料, faded), one over
  6 hours isn't shown before the new one.
- **Sports:** one session state for home and the sheet (`sessionStatus`);
  F1 數據 compare rebuilt (leader once, gaps right, key, every lap of a past
  session, two tyres a row), practice long runs and each tyre's best lap;
  live rows' 觀看 in the left column; Apple TV each MLS game's own page
  (Shared-Data watch.json `apple`) and 重播; 先發陣容 (lib/lineups.mjs: ESPN
  core rosters' starters for NBA/WNBA/NHL, MLB's probables and orders); this
  season's game log with preseason; `onAir` for home and 直播; 台灣轉播 lines
  short, 預計 at ELTA's slot.
- **Transit:** rides along their lines (Shared-Data shapes.mjs packs,
  lib/shapes.mjs network ways; trains stop by stop where TDX's shape has
  gaps); plan rows wrap, never cut; a picked place stays put; a trip shows
  only its own bikes; a station empty or full while navigating: the ride
  moved to one within 500 m; search topped up by Text Search; Google's plans
  shown before TDX's (`src`), first plans about twice as fast on long trips.

## The owner's list of 2026-10-11 (40 items, pushed to `main`)

- **Sports:** CPBL's 0 (TheSportsDB leaves a scoreless side empty), no
  CPBL win chart, CPBL's 季後賽 (`cpblSeeds`, the challenge's given win in
  its series, the Taiwan Series waiting). F1: one row design for every list
  (`f1Row`, team colour, F1's names), a qualifying not over between parts
  (`feedOver`/`feedBreak`, no early cut line), the last live reading until
  the official numbers come (`keptTiming` keeps a finished one 2 days),
  數據 beside the order (tyre stints, best sectors, speed trap: f1-live.js
  now trims `stints`, `grid`, `sectors`, `speed`, `pb` from TimingStats),
  clocks as the feed last said them, race control's turn incidents. Football
  過程 is the whole commentary (`commentary`, `soccerLineZh`), own goals the
  team's they counted for, goals a timeline with faces, 上半/下半. 數據 in the
  teams' colours and a broadcast's order. 轉播 drawn once its lists are in.
  Notices: the title the news; a start kept 10 min on the list.
- **Push Worker:** every sent notice remembered by tag and time (`toldKey`):
  an open app re-sending its list at a start no longer drops it. Weather
  notices `{title}` / `{place}`.
- **Kit:** `f1live.mjs` (dynamic import): Play settles F1 picks the moment
  F1's feed says a session is over and shows their place live.
- **Play:** slips as verdict + legs (parlay-aware), home row as the slip,
  account card merged, cash out greedy as a sportsbook (`LEG_CUT` 4%/6%,
  3% keep, reasons when paused), editing a slip (cash out into a new slip
  at today's odds, one save), locks rebalanced (`shadeLong`, ≤1.03 / ≥30,
  限 bands narrower), F1 two-way markets at the two-way cut, a league-tier
  cut (`TIER_CUT`), late qualifying keeps 排位賽第一 on sale (`waitsUntil`),
  drawn lock icon, game sheet waits for its lists, 場中焦點 from the last
  live read (`play.live.v1`).
- **Words:** checks by meaning with 不認識 (no cloze), types by training
  stage, retry the other way round, levels' monotone prior, how each miss
  happened (`h`) shown in 複習 and on flash cards.
- **Weather:** asks for the position unprompted once (`orbit-weather.geo.asked`); 定位 on the page after.

## The owner's follow-ups of 2026-10-10 evening (pushed to `main`)

- **Live on the minute (Sports):** `espn.mjs` `feedStarted` / `feedStatus` /
  `dueToStart`: F1's own feed saying a session has started (or ended) wins
  over ESPN's copy, on the cards, the day and the weekend sheet; the sheet
  re-reads every 15 s from a session's start (it had waited for ESPN to say
  one was on). 比分 re-reads for a game due to start. A CPBL game past its
  start is on at once on the device (its list is kept 2 minutes).
- **F1 results before jolpica (Sports):** a sprint, race or qualifying over
  with no jolpica rows yet is drawn from F1's archive (`/session.json`, the
  live board's shape, 冠軍 for the winner), never cached over jolpica's.
- **CPBL's play-offs (proxy, kit, Sports):** CPBL's lists of kind E (季後挑戰賽)
  and C (台灣大賽) read from September; TheSportsDB's round 0 is a play-off
  game (`playoff: true`). Sports' `cpblPlayoffs` names each by pairing and
  number (the first pairing the challenge, the next the Taiwan Series) as
  its stage; no series score (the challenge can start with a win given). A
  play-off box score is `/cpbl/box/<year>-E<n>.json`.
- **Transit stops' sides:** `bus.mjs` `stopSides` groups a stop's signs by
  bearing (≤45° one side), each side its own marker and card from zoom 17;
  further out one card with each side's buses under its way.
- **Play's speed:** opens on the saved board after 2 s (was 6; reopen 2.7 s
  like Sports), the saved board good 3 days minus games started, swapped
  once when today's is whole; standings asked for with each league's games.
  A cold open (no saved board) is still ~10 s: the live strip needs every
  league's games first. `fitNumbers` steps down until the text really fits.

## The owner's list of 2026-10-10 (33 items, all repos, pushed to `main`)

- **MLB playoffs (Sports, Play):** the nightly copy stays; MLB's own
  postseason list (`kit/postseason.mjs`, statsapi, one ~60 KB read for all
  of October, minutes fresh through the proxy) goes on top of every day:
  each playoff game's time or 待定, 如需, and a game MLB no longer lists
  (its series over) gone. Day pages and team schedules; Play sells a game
  MLB made sure.
- **Taiwan's holidays** (`kit/holidays.mjs`, the DGPA calendar, 2026–27):
  Class shows no classes and sends no class notices on one; Weather's and
  Transit's weekdays-only pins and trips skip it.
- **Upright only:** manifests `orientation: portrait`, and the kit turns
  the page back against a sideways phone (TRUTH §10).
- **F1:** a practice drawn with its best laps and gaps, live and after
  (F1's archive through `f1-live.js` `/session.json`); a session over by
  F1's feed ends at once; standings move only once a sprint or race is
  over; stopped cars greyed like retired ones; "LAP DELETED" in Chinese;
  the live board as a timing tower.
- **Sports:** 今日推薦開賽 notices (a kind of its own), no 「第一場」, a
  lone pick card spans the iPad's width.
- **Play:** the account card counts lottery tickets with bets, says 未結算
  until something's decided; preseason props at a preseason's minutes;
  the parlay boost in money; the bought-lottery sheet rebuilt; live picks
  green or red, no highlight box; short team names on cut lines.
- **Securities:** the stock sheet is a kit sheet (swipes down); the cash
  card's rate with what it earns. **Class:** sheets swipe down from
  anywhere, not just the handle.
- **Transit:** Google's bus stops hidden, ours on both sides of the
  street; a tapped stop centred above its card; the plans compact; a
  rarely-run route (5615) offers its next buses; a later bus picked isn't
  "趕不上"; one destination mark; stops on a trip (加一站, and from the
  nav menu, which now says what 換一條路 and 改目的地 each do); 結束 asks
  first. **Weather:** no warning banner; the page's shape while loading,
  the forecast coming in.

## Sports' four tabs by question; F1 drivers in English (2026-10-08, pushed to `main`)

- **One question per tab** (a game showed in up to five places before):
  首頁 *what to watch* (live, the picks, the rest), 賽事 *a league*
  (schedule, table, bracket, search), 轉播 (was 直播) *when and where*:
  what's on now with 觀看, 你的轉播 (followed teams', players' and
  matches' games on TV for 7 days, moved from 追蹤; no practice
  sessions), the next 24 hours' others, 剛結束, ELTA's full guide as one
  button (its next hours were the same games again), and 追蹤 *how
  they're doing* (the matches followed on their own, team and player
  cards; 你的聯賽 dropped: 賽事 lists followed leagues first). Hash
  `#live` stays (notices land there). Help (kit `help.mjs`) rewritten.
- **F1 drivers in English everywhere** (the owner's call: players of
  every other sport are in English): the kit's `f1Driver().zh` is the
  name as given; `F1_NAMES_ZH` is kept for reading old Play tickets
  ("羅素" → George Russell) and older app copies. An F1 story's line is
  translated with its drivers held as ⟦0⟧… and put back
  (`namedZh(text) → { text, back }`); teams stay Chinese (賓士).

## Footballers' official photos, news like a player's note, translations (2026-10-07, pushed to `main`)

- **Photos:** footballers outside the Premier League showed FotMob's faces (a
  head in a circle), not the studio half-body every other player has. Now
  Shared-Data's `official-photos.mjs` reads each league's own site each
  night: LaLiga's API (the public key its site sends), the Bundesliga's and
  Serie A's squad pages, Ligue 1's club summaries (`ma-api.ligue1.fr`).
  These go to `sports/<league>/photos.json` as `[name, url]`. Serie A's
  1024 px pictures are made 256 px by wsrv.nl. ESPN's short names are matched to the leagues' legal ones club by club (`clubFits`): on the day Serie A 88 of 93, the Bundesliga 54 of 57, Ligue 1 46 of 54 (the rest youngsters with no league photo). The kit
  (`kit/photos.mjs`) looks in all the football lists for any footballer
  (cups, transfers), then the feed's and ESPN's pictures, and FotMob's
  face last. MLS has its own list too (its content API). Everyone no league list has
  (Scotland, the European cups' other clubs, the FA Cup's lower leagues,
  national teams) gets TheSportsDB's studio cutout: Shared-Data looks up 450
  a night at its pace and keeps them (`sports/cutouts/photos.json`), so the
  list fills over a few nights. Celtic's and UEFA's own pictures were
  looked at: match photos and tight head crops, so not used.
- **No news, no Gemini (owner's call, 2026-10-09: "it's shit").** 最新動態
  and `latest.js` (Gemini on ESPN's and Google News's stories) are gone,
  and with them the RotoWire note card and the 3-day ESPN story card. In
  their place, the **injury report**, live from ESPN: a league's whole
  report in one read (`site.api.espn.com/…/<league>/injuries`, ten
  minutes; `leagueInjuries` in `Orbit-Sports/public/lib/espn.mjs`) on a
  team's page (傷兵報告: status chip, what, when back). A player's page
  keeps only its 🩹 tag (owner's call: no long report text there).
  Checked 2026-10-09: NBA (101 players), WNBA, NFL (800), NHL, MLB have
  one; NBL, college football (3) next to none; **ESPN keeps none for any
  soccer league** (league, team roster and core API all empty). Soccer
  options found: FPL's bootstrap-static (EPL only, `news` and
  `chance_of_playing_next_round`, 1.6 MB: would need a trim), FotMob's
  `/api/data/teams?id=` (every league, `squad…injured`/`injury.expectedReturn`
  and `overview.lastLineupStats.unavailable`, no key, 700 KB, its own team
  ids), Transfermarkt's per-league injury page (HTML); Sofascore 403s.
- **賽事幹事 in Chinese:** race control's messages are FIA set phrases,
  told by rule (`lib/racecontrol.mjs`), each car a driver chip that opens
  them; a message with unknown words stays English, cars still chips.
- **排名 before the first game:** last season's final table under a 上季
  banner (app.js `tableOf`, `standings(league, { season })`).
- **Translations:** text with Chinese in it (a name put in first) was sent
  with Google's language guess, which called it Chinese and gave it back in
  English. It's sent as English now, and news always is. Google's empty
  answers (`[[""]]`) used to be kept a month by the Worker and the device.
  Now they're a failure (`emptyTranslation`), asked again as English.

## KV off the limits, a stronger admin, news in Sports, F1 prices (2026-10-07, pushed to `main`)

- **KV:** the owner kept getting Cloudflare's KV free-tier emails. Rate limits
  are now counted in memory only (worker.js; the Quadra Pass is the guard,
  live header `x-ratelimit-backend: memory`). Orbit Weather keeps cells,
  national lists and its status in the Cache API with a KV copy at most hourly
  (weather.js keepJson/keptJson; the skill cron reads KV). Transit's TDX
  counts flush every 30 minutes. Push lists, due times and switches are
  written only when they change. The sports proxy has no KV binding.
- **Admin** (`site/admin`, eco-admin.js ADMIN_TOOLS): delete any account (the
  full 8-character reference typed to confirm; wallet, app data, inbox, share
  keys, device codes, push records), find an account by its Pass, undo a
  record, clear one app's data, export an account as JSON, broadcast a notice
  to an app's subscribers, and usage (Google and TDX against their caps).
  The admin route allows 600 calls an hour.
- **Sports news:** ESPN's stories on team, player, driver and F1-team sheets
  (a 新聞 tab; a story of the last 3 days leads as 最新消息), translated, with
  F1 drivers kept in English (since 2026-10-08; was the app's Chinese names). Proxy trim `espn-news`.
- **Play F1:** Kambi's race is the Grand Prix, never its practice or
  qualifying event. A Polymarket quote with $1,000 traded and a tight book is
  "firm": it is the driver's chance at its ask, over Kambi and older trades.
  Everyone else keeps the highest chance any source gives. Singapore 2026:
  Russell (back of the grid) 27.78.

## Orbit Class, third pass (2026-10-06, pushed to `main`)

- The card is `heroView` (src/schedule-calc.js, tested): on a break or in
  the morning the class coming is the card; the foot is two designed lines.
  今天 lists what's left first, 已上完 below. 工具's grid: `shortNames`.
- Double notice fixed in the kit: `schedulePush` remembers what the Worker
  already sent (`quadra.push.sent.<app>`, two days), and Class banners a
  class only in its notice's own minute.
- The top blur: Class was the one app on `black-translucent`; now `default`
  with a theme-color for light and dark (TRUTH §10). Unverified on a phone:
  iOS may keep the old style until the app is removed and added again.
- Not checked here: WebKit (none in the container). Pre-existing, seen with
  `--shuffle`: a device with nothing saved opens on the default schedule
  and swaps when the pass answers (the second opening is clean).
- preview.mjs `--clock 2026-10-06T10:05` sets the page's time.

## On the owner's Mac: Safari, and Transit's bus alerts by push (2026-10-04)

- **The owner works on a Mac now** (repos in `~/Documents/GitHub`; Orbit
  Words and Sports were in their old `Quadra-Hub` / `Quadra-Fixtures`
  folders until 2026-10-12, now `Orbit-Words` / `Orbit-Sports`). Node 22 and gh are in `~/.local`, Playwright (WebKit, Chromium)
  in `~/.local/opt/playwright`; `tools/preview.mjs --webkit` screenshots in
  Safari's engine. Xcode (the iOS Simulator) isn't installed yet.
- **A Mac's disk ignores case:** Orbit Words had `Celsius.mp3` beside
  `celsius.mp3` (a clone there showed them changed). Gone, with a test.
- **Safari:** bottom sheets use `dvh` beside `vh` (vh is the screen without
  Safari's toolbar, so a sheet's top went under it). An iPhone has no
  `navigator.vibrate`: Transit's buzz is a chime there (`lib/buzz.mjs`).
- **Transit's 到站提醒 by push:** they were only checked inside the app (every
  20 s), which an iPhone stops when it's locked. Now the app hands them to
  the Worker too (`schedulePush`, kind `bus`), `push.js` takes `transit` and
  a `check.bus` (the stop's TDX ask, the route and way, the minutes), asked
  again every cron run (2 min) and sent up to a minute early. Setting an
  alert turns notices on for the pass unless they were turned off.

## The rebrand: Quadra and Orbit, the kit served from one place (branch `claude/jolly-archimedes-99qqv7`)

- **Two families.** Quadra is where the money is: Quadra Securities, Quadra
  Play and the Quadra Pass. Orbit is the everyday tools: Orbit Class,
  Weather, Transit, **Orbit Sports** (was Quadra Fixtures) and **Orbit Words**
  (was Quadra Hub). Ids, storage keys, payload collections and cache names
  don't change (`match`, `vocab`, `quadra-hub-…`), nor the manifests' `id`.
- **The brand is `kit/brand.mjs`**: names, colours, lines, marks (Quadra: a
  square tile with a gold corner, the family mark four tiles with the fourth
  gold; Orbit: a planet, ring and moon). `brand/generate.mjs` writes every
  icon (maskable too), four share cards per app (og 1200×630, square
  1200×1200, X 1200×600, story 1080×1920; fonts cut to the card's characters
  and inlined, since Chromium here can't reach Google Fonts itself), each
  page's `<!-- brand -->` block, the manifests, and `site/` (the family's
  page, marks and cards). The old `og-image*`/`og-card*` files are gone.
- **The Quadra Pass sheet (`kit/pass.mjs`)** is Hub's Pass, Plus, Truth, Apps
  and Help, in every app: the account button opens it (`accountSheet`, now
  async), the ? opens its 說明 on this app (`openHelp`), `#help=<app>:<topic>`
  on any app's address opens it there (`helpUrl` points at the app itself).
  `truth.mjs` and `help.mjs` moved into the kit with their tests
  (`tests/pass.test.mjs`); help covers Weather and Transit now.
- **Orbit Words** only teaches words: tabs 今天 / 練習 / 進度 (`#words`
  still opens 今天), rose instead of violet; it no longer writes wallet
  settings (looks are worn from the Pass sheet).
- **The kit is served, not copied** (see README, "The shared kit and
  brand"): Pages deploys `kit/` and `site/`; each app's page has
  `kit/loader.html`'s snippets; modules import `#kit/…` (package.json
  imports → `.kit`, a link here, a checkout in CI). `kit/sync.mjs` is
  retired; `kit/apps.mjs` did the switch. **Needs Shared-Proxy's Pages on
  (Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions)**; until
  https://jaypengx.github.io/Shared-Proxy/kit/version.json answers, the apps'
  switch must not reach `main` (they'd load no kit).
- **Renaming** (by hand, README "Renaming Quadra-Fixtures and Quadra-Hub"):
  rename the repos, set `RENAMED = true` in `kit/brand.mjs`, push here;
  `tools/moved/` is the stub for the old addresses.
## Orbit Transit, round 4 (branch `claude/practical-allen-y0jnq2`, pushed to `main`)

- **TPASS rules** (`tpass.mjs`): 台鐵's 太魯閣, 普悠瑪 and EMU3000 (type
  codes 1, 2, 11) and 高鐵 are never on the pass. A trip with both ends in
  your pass's cities keeps only plans the pass takes (`rank`'s `keep`,
  falling back to everything when nothing's left); our rail router and
  查時刻's search look only at those trains then (查時刻 says so). Fares
  show 「TPASS 涵蓋」 per leg.
- **Fewer changes**: `bikeToRail`/`bikeFromRail` take `at` (a ride index):
  by YouBike to the bus after a change, or off the first one and on by
  bike; changes cost 14 (bus→bus) / 9 minutes in `score`.
- **每 30 分鐘換車**: the planner adds the whole city's stations at both
  ends (`cityBikes`), so `swapRides` finds one where the cut falls (the
  ~5 km grid of points used to miss it).
- **Streets**: walks and YouBike rides of an opened plan (and walking to a
  stop) are drawn by FOSSGIS's OSRM (`routing.openstreetmap.de`,
  `roadPath` in api.mjs, CORS open, light use only, kept per session).
- **Trips**: `alt: [{ days, time, back }]` (days with their own times,
  each day once; an empty time uses the usual); `tripNow` finds the next
  day the trip runs (Sunday → Monday's) at that day's time.
- **交通** has no 附近 any more; ★ unpins a stop or a train there; 查時刻's
  pins toggle.
- **Map**: nearest YouBike stations along the bottom; bus stops one per
  name within 90 m (`stopGroups`; the card asks each and says 往 …); 走過去 /
  騎 YouBike to a stop, navigated at once; 到站提醒 (`alerts.mjs`: checked
  every 20 s while the app runs, a notification once, kept 2 h); search
  shows your places and 最近 (deletable), stations nearest first; the
  proxy's `/transit/search` puts a chain's near branches first
  (`nearFirst`: asked again inside 15 km when Google's are all far).
- **捷運路網圖** sits at z-index 60 (the sticky header covered its city
  buttons); opens on the system you're within 10 km of, else your last.
- **Tickets** (`tickets.mjs`): no operator offers a link that fills its
  form or opens its app at a train, so 訂票 opens the booking site and
  copies 「高鐵 613 次 · 10/05 07:30 · 新竹 → 台北」.
- Preview: the kit now loads from `../Shared-Proxy/kit/`, so a local
  server must serve `/Orbit-Transit/` and `/Shared-Proxy/` side by side.

## Orbit Transit, round 2 (branch `claude/practical-allen-y0jnq2`, pushed to `main`)

The owner's 22-point list. Done:

- **Worker placement:** `wrangler.toml` `[placement] region = "gcp:asia-east1"`
  (was `gcp:us-east4` for Gemini): seen live `cf-placement: remote-TPE`
  (`X-Worker-Colo` is the ingress colo, not where it ran). Gemini's region
  is the owner's separate session.
- **Kit:** everything inside `.q-gate` is `border-box` (the install steps
  scrolled 8 px sideways in Transit and Weather). Orbit-Weather's synced copy
  is committed locally in this session but its push to `main` was refused
  (that repo wasn't in the session's scope): sync it next time.
- **Proxy `/transit/route`:** `modes=` (bus, tra, hsr, metro, bike) →
  Google `allowedTravelModes` and TDX `transit` codes, learned live with
  `status?sample=maas&transit=`: **5 = every bus, 3,4 together = 台鐵+高鐵
  (4 alone refused, 3 alone empty), 6–9 = metro (only beside 3,4)**; no bike →
  no `tdxBike` ask. Up to 16 plans back (the app ranks). TDX calls time out
  at 12 s, a 5xx asked once more.
- **Why 新竹縣體育場 → 竹東高中 looked bad:** the planners *do* find the
  owner's routes by day (TDX's YouBike first mile: bike → 文興嘉豐 → 快捷8號支
  → 竹東火車站 → bike; bike → 喜來登 → 5700; bike → 千甲 → 內灣線), but the
  app sorted by arrival only, so 5615 → 新竹市 → 5608 detours led. 快捷8號
  runs 9 times a day (last 18:30 from 竹北) and 5700 7 (last 15:00): at
  night they can't appear. Now `plan.mjs` `score()`: minutes to arrival + 7
  per change (10 bus→bus) + walking past 6 min + riding + detour
  ((path/direct − 1.2) × 45) + heading away + fare/12 (TPASS-covered = 0) +
  missed train; top 4 with different main lines are 推薦; waits > 90 min
  half way dropped. Checked on saved real answers (Mon 07:30/11:30/16:00).
- **App:** `planner.mjs` (one pipeline for 地圖 and 交通), `live.mjs` (TDX
  N1 at a plan's stops re-times its buses; `busLink` = direct bus between two
  places, used for train → bus egress), `nav.mjs` (navigation: GPS, live bus
  ETA, buzz before the stop, Google Maps deep link per walk/bike step: no
  billed call), tabs 地圖 / 交通 (`tab-go`) / 查時刻 (`tab-times` + `tab-train`)
  / 我的 (`tab-me`, metro map on `createMap`). Pass data adds `saved` (trips:
  from null = here, time, by, days, back), `pins` (train connections / train
  numbers), `prefs` (modes, bike30, tpass). `tpass.mjs`: 桃竹竹苗 1200, 桃竹竹
  799, 竹竹苗 699, 竹竹 288 (YouBike first 30 min), 基北北桃, 中彰投苗, 南高屏.
- **Metro live data:** TDX's TRTC LiveBoard lists only trains about to
  arrive (29 rows city-wide), so most stations had none: the timetable now
  shows beside it. TMRT has neither live nor timetable on TDX.
- **Not done / next:** navigation cost note (owner asked): Routes API
  bike/walk paths would be Compute Routes Essentials, 10,000 free a month
  then US$5 / 1,000 (shared with the transit cap); Navigation SDK is
  Android/iOS only; chosen: free deep links. Recurring-trip notifications
  (push) weren't built.

## Orbit Transit, phase 1 (branch `claude/orbit-transit-web-app-e5vwsh`, pushed to `main`)

The owner's ask: a transit app for Taiwan (they live in 新竹). A map home
(Google, the most detail) with YouBike (regular and 電輔車), every bus stop,
台鐵 / 高鐵 / metro stations; search, pins, tap and go; multi-plan routes with
"strong YouBike ideas"; 公車 groups (named, ordered, swiped) with arrivals;
火車 with smart transfers (支線, 台鐵 ↔ 高鐵); 捷運 maps with a station's live
board. Quadra Pass sign-in; Chinese; always dark. App repo
`JayPengX/Orbit-Transit` (README there lists the files).

- **Live since 2026-10-03** (keys in, owner on a paid TDX plan; Google's
  billing has a NT$150 budget): `TDX_PER_MIN` = 240 (`wrangler.toml`; the old
  default 5 was why YouBike and most cards said 暫時無法存取資料).
  `GET /transit/status?sample=<name>` shows one real answer (TDX samples
  through the shared cache; `maas`, `maas-local`, `google-route` cached an
  hour). Seen live: TDX's planner sections are `type` pedestrian / transit /
  cycle / drive, `transport.mode` in its own words (`TRA`, `HighwayBus`,
  `cycle`, `YOXI` = taxi), with zero-length cycle / taxi stubs at the ends
  (dropped). It returns few plans (2 across 新竹 → 竹北, buses only), so the
  app adds 台鐵 / 高鐵 plans from its own router (`railPlans`, plan.mjs) and
  shows every plan (no domination filter: the owner wants them all).
  **Google's `computeRoutes` answers 403 API_KEY_SERVICE_BLOCKED**: the
  server key's API restrictions must include Routes API (owner's action).
  公路客運 stations (UID `THB…`) carry the city's `LocationCityCode`, but
  only `InterCity` knows them: `stationEta` goes by the UID's prefix.
  Later the same day (the owner: "暫時無法取得資料" everywhere): TDX's paid
  plan refuses past **5 calls a second** (`429 API rate limit exceeded`) and
  an app opening fires ~20; the Worker then shut TDX off for 30 s. Now
  `TDX_PER_SEC` = 4 queues calls (up to 8 s) and asks a 429 again. A failed
  TDX answer now carries `upstream` and `why`. TDX's planner times have no
  zone (Taiwan's; they were read as UTC, 8 h late). `/transit/route` asks
  TDX twice: walking, and with YouBike first / last mile
  (`first_mile_mode=3`, source `tdxBike`), which finds the owner's own
  pattern (bike → 快捷8號 → bike). TRA `ODFare` lists each pair twice, the
  short way and round the island (862 km): take the shortest. 快捷8號 is
  新竹縣's (`HSQ`), not 新竹市's. Testing live: `POST /eco {op:'create',
  app:'transit'}` gives a throwaway pass whose `token` works as `qt`
  (delete it after with `DELETE /eco?qt=`).
- **Data:** TDX (tdx.transportdata.tw) for everything transit; it refuses
  calls without a key (`401 Valid API Key Required`). Its free plan (基礎) is
  3 points a month (1,500 calls or 150 MB a point) and **5 calls a minute
  per key**; 銅級 is NT$200 a month for 200 points and 5 a second. The owner
  registered (or is registering) for a key; which plan was left open (asked;
  the answer was "I live in hsinchu": every city's live buses must work, so
  nothing is Taipei-only). On the free plan live data refreshes slowly: the
  Worker paces itself (`TDX_PER_MIN`, default 5) and serves the last copy
  when TDX is busy.
- **Google** (the owner's choice, with "monthly free tries so we never run
  out" and "all web kind of thing hosted on our proxy"): every billed call
  goes through `/transit` and counts against `CAPS` (KV `transit:use:<month>`,
  Pacific-time month, flushed in batches of 10 or every 2 minutes): Dynamic
  Maps 9,000 (a map load = `/transit/config`), Autocomplete 9,000, Place
  Details Essentials 9,000 (position, address), Place Details Pro 4,500 (a
  tapped place's name), Compute Routes Essentials (transit) 9,000. Past a cap:
  NLSC's map (Leaflet), OpenStreetMap's search, no Google plans. The Maps
  JavaScript API itself must load in the browser (Google serves its tiles),
  so the browser key comes from `/transit/config`, only to signed-in apps.
  **The hard stop is Google Cloud's quotas** (the Worker's count is
  approximate): the owner should set per-day quotas on Maps JavaScript API
  (300 map loads), Places API (New) (300 autocomplete, 300 details) and
  Routes API (300) in Google Cloud → APIs & Services → each API → Quotas.
- **Still needed from the owner** (nothing works live until then):
  1. Worker secrets (Cloudflare → orbit-workers-proxy → Settings →
     Variables and Secrets, type Secret): `TDX_CLIENT_ID`,
     `TDX_CLIENT_SECRET`; `GOOGLE_MAPS_BROWSER_KEY` (a new key: Application
     restriction "Websites" `https://jaypengx.github.io/*`, API restriction
     Maps JavaScript API only). Places API (New) and Routes API enabled on
     the project; they use `GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY`, or `GOOGLE_WEATHER_KEY` when
     that isn't set (its API restrictions must then include them).
     Optional var `TDX_PER_MIN` = 300 on 銅級.
  2. Orbit-Transit repo → Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions (the
     workflow deploys `public/` on push to `main`).
  3. Then check `GET /transit/status` (keys true, use counts).
- **Unverified until the key is in:** every TDX path and field is from TDX's
  own OpenAPI documents (fetched 2026-10-03: basic v2 bus / rail / bike, v3
  rail, advanced bus / bike / rail, MaaS), but no live answer has been seen.
  TDX's planner (`maas/routing`) documents its parameters but not its
  sections' shape: `parseTdxRoutes` reads HERE's public-transit shape
  loosely; look at a real answer first thing. The made-up fixtures for the
  preview (`tests/fixtures/transit/upstream.mjs`) follow the documented
  shapes.
- **The train router** (`Orbit-Transit/public/lib/rail.mjs`): the day's
  whole 台鐵 (v3 `DailyTrainTimetable/TrainDate`) and 高鐵 (v2
  `DailyTimetable/TrainDate`) timetables (2 TDX calls a day, shared) as
  connections; Connection Scan for the earliest arrival, run again after
  each first departure, dominated options dropped; changes cost 3–5 min (by
  station class; 高鐵 4), walks link stations of different railways within
  900 m (六家 ↔ 高鐵新竹, 新烏日 ↔ 台中, 沙崙 ↔ 台南, 新左營 ↔ 左營, 豐富 ↔
  苗栗, the shared halls of 南港 / 台北 / 板橋). Metro isn't in it yet (the
  map's planner covers metro trips).
- **YouBike plans** (`plan.mjs`): all the way (≤ 12 km; 電輔車 from 2 km),
  bike to the first train/metro instead of a bus or a 600 m+ walk (same
  train, leave later), bike from the last one (there sooner); live bikes and
  docks from TDX NearBy (a ~500 m grid so asks share). Riding 230 m/min
  (電輔 300) ×1.25 for streets, a minute to take and a minute to return.
- **Metro maps** (`metro.mjs`): stations where they are; lines drawn by
  TDX's StationOfRoute (each operating route continuous, so 蘆洲 branches
  at 大橋頭), StationOfLine with jump-splitting as the fallback. Dots and
  names are counter-scaled (CSS translate + scale(1/zoom)): one size on
  screen at any zoom.
- **Pass data** (`orbit-transit`, `t1:` JSON, 100 KB): groups (12 × 16
  stops), places (20), recent trips and train searches, layers; the newer
  copy wins.
- **Kit:** `APPS.transit` (green `#22c55e`, related); `kit/sync.mjs`
  targets Orbit-Transit. Only Orbit-Weather and Orbit-Transit were checked
  out this session; the other apps get the new `APPS` entry at their next
  sync.

## Fixtures: the date strip's freeze and jump, every F1 session (pushed to `main`)

- The date strip (`dateStrip`) grows only on the person's own scrolling
  (`range.held`, set by touch / pointer / wheel): a sport's few days (賽車)
  barely overflow, so each centring grew, refilled and re-centred it, and
  iPhone Safari never stopped (the freeze after 我的球隊 → 賽車).
- A repaint keeps a scrolled strip where it was (`range.left`, applied by
  `centerChosen`); picking a day or a filter centres it again.
- F1: practice (FP1–3) is listed in 賽事 and the race sheet, never on
  首頁 (`practice` in app.js: picks, live block, a sport's days); ELTA's programs match a session by its name (第1節, 排位賽…)
  within 3 hours; every F1 session counts as on ELTA (`every` in
  BROADCAST, its 2026-2029 rights), its channel once the list names it.
- 賽事 places a race weekend by all its sessions. The race sheet's
  qualifying shows best lap, gap to pole (last part only) and Q1/Q2 out
  (`qualiRows`, Jolpica's qualifying, else ESPN's); sprint qualifying from
  ESPN core's per-car statistics (`espnQualifying`, 22 calls, 6 h cache:
  Jolpica has none). OpenF1 refuses everyone during a live session, so it
  isn't used.
- Small-hours big games (00–05, `nightOnly`) are only among 更多推薦, never
  今日推薦; a followed team's still can be.

## Fixtures: live F1 timing, title times, NBA and soccer live (pushed to `main`)

- **F1 live board** from F1's own live timing: `f1-live.js` here (served as
  `https://f1-live.quadra/now.json`, 4 s shared cache) opens
  livetiming.formula1.com/signalrcore without a login over server-sent
  events (negotiate, stream, handshake, Subscribe), takes the first answer
  (the whole state) and trims it. Fixtures' race sheet draws it every 5 s in
  place (`f1LiveBoard`): part and time left, flag, race control's latest,
  each car's place, tyre, best lap / gap or gap / interval, pits, knocked
  out, the qualifying cut line. ESPN's live copy lags minutes and its gaps
  stand still; OpenF1 refuses everyone during a session; F1's static files
  only come after it. Locally: `NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY=1
  NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=/root/.ccr/ca-bundle.crt node tools/preview.mjs …`.
- **Title sequence times:** F1 sessions are shown at the time ELTA (Sky's
  coverage of the international feed) plays F1's theme: `TITLES_BEFORE` in
  Fixtures' espn.mjs (race 10 min early, sprint 5, the rest 4; estimates,
  F1 publishes none), the official time kept as `official`.
- **NBA live:** each side's top scorer and team fouls from the 15 s summary,
  the last plays; 過程 lists every play (`feed`). **Soccer:** a 球員 tab from
  the lineups' own numbers.
- **Live, one look:** every sport's card has a two-line live line like
  baseball's (NBA: each side's points leader with faces, from the
  scoreboard's `leaders`; soccer: the latest goal; F1: the top three from
  F1's feed, `f1Brief`, filled in place every 10 s). The F1 board uses the
  result's own rows (`f1Row`) and comes first in its sheet while a session
  runs; the NBA panel uses the batter / pitcher layout.
- **Playoffs for every league** (`lib/playoffs.mjs`, `playoffData` in
  app.js): each league's format (MLB, NBA, MLS, 歐冠 / 歐霸 / 歐協聯,
  歐國聯, 英足總盃, 世界盃); real games while they're on, the first round
  predicted from the table while the season's on (seeds; the cups' league
  phase 9-24; League A's groups), last season's when this one hasn't begun
  (`seasonInfo` in espn.mjs gives the phase; NBA = last season now). Rounds
  dated from their games (ESPN's TBD games too), a cup's calendar stages, or
  about 3 days after a regular season's last day. Shown as the swiped map
  (the owner preferred it to round tabs), opening on the round that's on.
- **Brackets** (賽事 → 季後賽 / 淘汰賽): `lib/bracket.mjs` from games with
  `round` (espn.mjs `knockoutRound`): MLB, NBA, MLS (the days around now,
  75 back) and every cup (its season's games). Ties by round and sides,
  series wins / aggregate / score, who went through, each tie beside the
  one it feeds, 待定 places. Dummy data for screenshots: preview's
  `--fixture 'basketball/nba/scoreboard=file.json'` (a whole postseason in
  one answer, dates shifted).
- **CPBL:** cpbl.com.tw's live box (`/box/getlive`, POST with the page's
  token) would give the count, batter and box, but its CDN answers 308 to
  the POST from here, and on 2026-10-03 the Worker's CPBL schedule failed
  (`cpbl page 404; tsdb 429`): open.

## Orbit Weather, phase 1: the proxy's sources (branch `claude/intelligent-euler-2ifltk`, pushed to `main`)

Planned in `docs/WEATHER-PLAN.md`; the PWA's repo is `JayPengX/Orbit-Weather`
(empty so far).

- Keys: `GOOGLE_WEATHER_KEY`, `CWA_KEY`, `MOENV_KEY` are Worker secrets, all
  three checked live (`GET /weather/status`, cached 10 minutes, keys never
  shown). The Google key first had a "Websites" restriction (403
  `API_KEY_HTTP_REFERRER_BLOCKED`); the owner set it to None.
- `weather.js`: `GET /weather?lat=&lon=&qt=` (a Quadra Pass session, 30 a
  minute) answers the plan's C4 shape for the 0.01° cell, from KV
  (`weather:cell:<cell>`, fresh 15 minutes, up to 3 hours answered at once
  and refreshed behind). Google: current, 48 hours in 2 pages (24 a page
  at most, whatever `pageSize` says), 10 days; alerts only abroad (they
  refuse `unitsSystem`). CWA: the township's 3-day and week forecast (county
  datasets `F-D0047-0xx`, `COUNTY_IDS`), the nearest automatic / manned /
  rain-gauge station (`StationId=`), warnings by county. MOENV: AQI sites
  and the area forecast, kept whole in KV. Rain and temperature blended
  0.6 Google / 0.4 CWA (`weather:weights` in KV overrides, for phase 2);
  "now" is the station's measurement when it's within 5 km and 90 minutes.
  Advice (plan D) computed here, thresholds in `ADVICE`.
- **One truth** (the owner's rule): the answer has one value for each thing
  and names no source; each source's values stay in the cell's KV entry
  (`bySource`) for the scoring. A test fails if a source's name or a
  per-source field reaches the answer.
- The Worker is on the Free plan (10 ms CPU): CWA's national station lists
  (~1 MB each) are never parsed live. `weather-stations.js` is the committed
  table (1,367 stations), rebuilt by `node tools/weather-stations.mjs` from
  the Worker's samples (`/weather/status?sample=<name>`, cached an hour).
- `/weather/status?sample=forecast` is `/weather` at Taipei 101 without a
  pass (refreshed at most hourly), for checks.
- **A Quadra app now** (the owner's call, replacing the earlier no-sign-in
  version): `weather` is an `ECO_APPS` app (collection `orbit-weather`, its
  payload `w1:` the pins and the brief time) and a kit `APPS` entry (related,
  indigo `#6366f1`, notice kinds `brief` / `rain`); `/weather` and
  `/weather/where` need a session (30 a minute a session); push goes through
  the kit (`schedulePush`), the device-id route is gone.
- `/weather` is hourly for 10 days: the near hours each refresh (4 calls),
  hours 49–240 every 6 hours (8 more, chained page tokens);
  `GOOGLE_DAILY_CALLS` = 450. Someone waiting on a cell (none kept, or kept
  over 3 hours) gets a quick build first (`quick`: now, 48 hours, the 10
  days, CWA, the stations; the last far hours and Google air if any), answered
  with `more: true`; the far hours (10 calls) and Google's air finish behind
  it (`waitUntil`, restarted after `QUICK_FINISH_MS`), and the page asks again
  every 4 s (`MORE_MS`, 5 times at most) until `more` is gone. `air.history` (the nearest site's last 48 h,
  from `weather:aqi:hist`, written by the hourly cron) and
  `air.forecast.days`. `/weather/where` = NLSC's TownVillagePointQuery1
  (county / town / village), Cloudflare-cached 30 days by ~100 m.
- The app (`JayPengX/Orbit-Weather`): kit frame (boot.js loading, watchUpdates,
  installGate, topActions), always dark (`data-theme="dark"`); a page per place
  (here, then pins, swiped); top (place to 里, now, high / low with 體感), UV,
  rain and air cards with sideways graphs, advice cards, 10 days (a day's sheet
  overlays everything), a big info card. Pins: name, place, days and hours (the
  app opens on the pin inside them). Radar removed. `tools/preview.mjs weather`
  shows it signed in (weather.js on the fixtures, real NLSC).
- Graphs are rows of small elements (`.tl` / `.tl-col` in the app's
  `lib/graph.mjs`), not one long SVG: iPhone Safari dropped parts of the
  6,000-px-wide SVGs while scrolling (the owner saw "empty hours"; the
  Worker's answers had none, checked with `/weather/status?cells=1`, which
  lists the recent cells' blank hours and sources without their places).
  UV shows daylight hours only; a date chip follows each graph's swipe.
- Air as far as it goes: Google's Air Quality API (`forecast:lookup`, POST,
  Taiwan's AQI `twn_epa`, 96 hours, 1 call every 6 h a cell) pulled toward
  the station's reading (fading over 12 h) and blended day by day with
  MOENV's 3-day area forecast (0.5 / 0.5; Google alone past it, MOENV alone
  without Google) → `air.hourly`, `air.forecast.days`. **The key is refused
  (403 `API_KEY_SERVICE_BLOCKED`)** until the owner enables "Air Quality
  API" for it in Google Cloud (and adds it to the key's API restrictions);
  until then the Worker asks once a day a cell and uses MOENV alone
  (`/weather/status?sample=google-air` shows the answer).
- The app's page is a plain column of blocks (`.wx-page > *`), not grid or
  flex: iPhone Safari squeezed the top card (a clipping item in a scrolling
  grid) to a strip. Settings (⚙︎) order the cards and hide some; the pass
  payload carries `cards` and `hidden` (the newer copy wins).
- Air history at once: the nearest site's last 48 hours from MOENV's
  `aqx_p_488` (`filters=sitename,EQ,<name>&sort=datacreationdate desc`,
  KV `weather:aqi:site:<name>`, 50 minutes), merged with the cron's.
- Advice for daily life (`lifeAdvice`): `commute` (7–9 / 17–19 rain),
  `outdoor` (the best 2 hours, 6–19), `laundry` (first dry day; week marks),
  `window` (AQI ≤ 50 and dry / AQI > 100), `sleep` (tonight 23–5 feels),
  `carwash` (3 dry days). The app shows the day's tiles and one week table
  (rain, laundry, UV, wear, heat, air × 7 days, ★ the best day).
- 我的行程 (app `lib/plan.mjs`): the first page once there's a pin. A pin
  may be `home` (one at most; where you are outside every other pin's
  hours; without one, the device's place). Each hour is taken from the
  place the schedule says (`placeAt`); `routeForecast` makes the places'
  forecasts one (same shape as a city's: hours with `place`, days from the
  hours where you are, route advice), drawn by the same cards. Notices
  follow it too.
- Graphs (`lib/graph.mjs` `chart`): smooth area charts (bars for days)
  coloured by level, fitted to the card's width — no sideways scrolling
  inside the swiping pager; the cards' tabs pick the range (rain 24 h /
  48 h / 10 days, UV the next daylight day / the one after / 10 days; the
  choice kept on the device). Dragging on a graph moves the crosshair
  (`touch-action: pan-y`). Air: now and MOENV's forecast days, no history.
- The page shows rain / UV / air as small cards (`metrics`: the value, a
  line, a sentence); a tap opens the big graph in a sheet (tabs, read-out,
  drag). The crosshair is HTML moved by transform, once a frame. The place
  chips update in place and a tap jumps (no smooth scroll: Safari's snapping
  fights it); a page is redrawn only when its data changes. Old layouts'
  `uv` / `rain` / `air` become `metrics`.
- A day's sheet (tap a day): the day's summary, then big charts (temperature
  with feels-like and the high / low; rain and UV under it, same hours), the
  read-out following a finger and back to the summary when it lifts; then
  that day's own advice (`dayTips` in cards.mjs, from its hours). The week
  table is gone from the page. Crosshairs show only while touched.
- 我的行程 shows advice, rain, UV and the days only (what matters on the
  move); its advice is the route's plus the daytime place's run / thunder /
  wind / fog / temperature.
- More advice (`lifeAdvice`): `run` (best 2 hours 6–20時 today and
  tomorrow, a time a day in the week), `laundry` (every dry day, drying
  hours), `weekend`, `humid`, `temp` (lows dropping / rising ≥ 4°), `wind`
  (gusts ≥ 50 km/h), `thunder` (≥ 40%), `fog` (≤ 1 km).
- Advice for the week: each kind (`umbrella`, `sun`, `wear`, `heat`,
  `mask`, `week`) has `week: { text, days: [{ date, mark, v }] }` over the
  advice day and the 6 after; a kind today doesn't need still comes (level
  `none`) when the week does.
- **Scoring** (`weather-skill.js`, plan C7): the cron at :10 each hour scores
  the 6 cells opened most lately (`weather:recent`, noted at most every 6 h
  a cell) from snapshots of their own refreshes (no extra Google calls)
  against the nearest CWA rain gauge (≥ 0.5 mm: rained; Brier) and station
  (absolute error), 0–6 h / 6–24 h, 14 days in `weather:skill:<cell>`. Once
  a day after 3 days of scores, `weather:weights` moves (∝ 1/score, floor
  0.15, at most 0.1 a day). `GET /weather/skill`: weights and mean scores,
  no places. Never in the app.
- **Notices** (`push.js`, app `weather`): checks
  `{ weather: { lat, lon, kind: 'brief' | 'rain' } }` run `weatherCheck`:
  the brief in one line (`briefText`), the rain alert when the next 2 hours
  reach 60% (re-checked every 15 minutes until `until`; the forecast read
  with a 1-hour freshness so it costs at most a refresh an hour).
- `/weather` answers a one-sentence `headline` (from the numbers, no model).

## Play: Kambi first, real markets, players, new leagues, live (branch `claude/gallant-goodall-gtyxjg`, pushed to `main`)

- **Prices:** an ESPN league with a `kambi` path in the catalogue (LEAGUES'
  `book`) gets Kambi's list as its first price (`attachKambi`), DraftKings
  (through ESPN) averaged in (`blendOutcomes`); the two more than
  `BOOKS_APART` (0.12) apart on any outcome locks the game (`lock: 'check'`).
  The house's own standings price (house.mjs) sells the winner only, `cap:
  'house'`; a ticket with a capped pick costs at most `SLIP_RULES.capped`
  (NT$1,000).
- **A game's own markets:** opening a game (or a pick on the slip) reads
  Kambi's `betoffer/event/<id>.json` through the proxy's new `kambi-offers`
  trim (lib/offers.mjs). Kinds Kambi prices replace the model's (same option
  ids, so slip picks survive); new kinds `dnb`, `corners`, `set1`,
  `setscore`. Only markets the page settles exactly are taken (whole-game
  lines, half lines, no Asian quarter lines; `LINES_SHOWN` 7 per kind).
  Odd/even is gone; long shots (score, HT/FT, bands, top inning) sit under
  更多.
- **Players (球員):** lib/props.mjs maps Kambi's player markets to ESPN
  box-score stats (soccer, MLB, NFL, NHL, NBA when listed); settled from the
  game's summary (`propOutcome`); a player who didn't play (MLB: not in the
  starting lineup) is void; a soccer tie that went to extra time voids
  players' picks. Capped like house prices; never recommended.
- **Soccer on 90 minutes:** `parseEspnResults` counts two halves for a final
  after extra time or penalties (it used the extra-time score before).
- **New leagues:** NCAAF, NBL, Championship, Eredivisie, Liga MX,
  Brasileirão (ESPN + Kambi), ATP, WTA, UFC (Kambi's list, settled from ESPN's
  tour and card scoreboards: `parseEspnDuel`; retirements, walkovers, draws
  and no contests void; tennis game handicap / total games / first set / set
  score). The owner asked for them back after the purge; Fixtures still shows
  only what Taiwan can watch.
- **The model fills every gap:** players' picks for every regular of both
  teams (lib/players.mjs reads ESPN's rosters, through the proxy's
  `espn-roster` trim, and each league's season list, `espn-athletes`, 1,000
  a page; last season's added at half weight while this one is young), priced
  by lib/propmodel.mjs at MODEL_CUT (1.25), Kambi's own pick winning where
  both exist; ESPN headshots on every player (kit photos.mjs now synced to
  Play too). Soccer's draw no bet and corners, tennis's first set, set score,
  game handicap and total games (lib/tennis.mjs, from the winner's price) when
  Kambi has none. House-priced games sell every market again (capped ticket).
- **Live:** Kambi's in-play lists for every ESPN league on now
  (`attachKambiLive`): winner (soccer with its draw), main total and
  handicap replace the model's; an open live game reads its own markets
  every 20 s. NHL's regular-time 1X2 is never taken for the winner.

## Round of 2026-10-01 (fourth list), branch `claude/happy-wright-eqzr16`

All on `main`. A parallel Copilot agent's round before this one was reviewed
and largely redone (its Hub work was never committed; its NBA.com feature
could not work; its logo change made flashing worse; it had cut this file
down, restored here).

- **Quadra Hub** (was Rewards; repo and Pages path `Quadra-Hub`, the local
  folder too, `kit/sync.mjs` targets it): an independent add-on (APPS.vocab
  `related`, not in FAMILY). Tabs: 單字 (practice centre), Pass (wallet,
  Plus, a member's avatar and frame, devices), 真相 (where money comes from,
  house edge, what boosts, free bets and Plus really cost, trading and
  overdraft costs), Apps. Every game, mission, shop and points spend is gone.
  Vocab (`public/lib/words.mjs`): distractors are the closest look-alikes
  (spelling, overlapping meaning, part of speech, words this person confused
  before); smart mode lets each box take several kinds and a round goes
  through them all; scheduling is FSRS-5 per word (stability, difficulty,
  due at 90% recall; answer time and question kind weigh the grade); 背新字
  shows new words as cards and a full batch unlocks a quiz on it; misses
  come back at a round's end. The TOEIC/IELTS/Business packs are gone.
- **錢從哪裡來** (kit `moneySides`): an account older than the shared wallet
  has no `eco:start`; its NT$110,000 opening sat in Securities' and Play's
  books, so with `eco:rebase:v3` present the opening counts as 110,000 − 80,000.
- **Plus** is for Play and Securities only (kit PLUS): NT$490 / NT$4,900 a
  year; Play: NT$200 bonus bet a week, parlay boost ×1.5, better cash-out;
  Securities: commission ×0.28, smaller FX spread, lending fee cut; avatars
  and frames are Plus-only. The Worker accepts entries of eco, stock and odds
  only; no migration code: retired data goes by the admin clean
  (eco-admin.js tidyWallet / RETIRED_SETTINGS; scan shows `wouldRetire`).
- **Kit images:** `logoPicture` never flashes (drawn ones stay decoded and are
  remembered across launches, `quadra.logos.v2`; new ones hidden by inline
  style, fade in; failures retried 3 times, hidden meanwhile).
  `kit/sw-images.js` (imported by each app's sw.js) keeps every picture from
  another site on the device (`quadra-images-v1`, weekly refresh). NBA logos
  are NBA.com's (`NBA_ID`; ESPN's Celtics file is the shamrock alternate).
- **Fixtures:** only what ELTA.tv or Apple TV show in Taiwan (BROADCAST is the
  league list; MLS on Apple TV, everything else ELTA). F2 and F3 were removed
  (catalogue, app and the Worker's F2/F3 sites); ELTA's other sports (Asian
  Games, BWF, WTT…) were added and then taken out again at the owner's word.
  NBA.com's Taiwan schedule (cdn.nba.com refuses Cloudflare and this
  container) is fetched by the deploy workflow (`scripts/nba-elta.mjs`, also
  every 6 h by cron) into `public/nba-elta.json`: ELTA's NBA games for the
  season, two a day where so. Recommendations only include games with an
  exact broadcast; 追蹤 shows followed teams' next game and where to watch;
  one-tap 觀看 opens the ELTA app; F1 flags; TBD sides get no logo address.
- **Securities:** TradingView icons for every Taiwan listing, the official
  logo where its icon is stale (統一超, RBLX, MCD); 已實現損益 in broker
  wording; amount fields no longer rebuilt while typing; 修改定期定額 opens
  no keyboard.
- **Play:** home's balance card without buttons that repeated the tabs (a
  crash on home from the purge round, `follow`/`habits`, fixed).
- **Firestore:** cleaned on 2026-10-01 (token set, scan, clean, token
  cleared): 3 wallets; one tidied (57 retired Rewards entries and 7 settings
  removed, their net NT$7,648 kept as one `eco:rebase:hub` entry so the
  balance didn't change); nothing else to delete. A second scan found none.

## Round of 2026-10-01 (third list), branch `claude/admiring-hypatia-j60tqo`

All pushed to `main` unless marked.

- **Purge (clean, nothing hidden):** tennis, golf, UFC, boxing, volleyball,
  table tennis, badminton, MotoGP, F1 Academy, GT World Challenge, the WC
  qualifiers and every league Taiwan couldn't watch (the old NO_TAIWAN list)
  are deleted from the kit catalogue, both apps, the proxy (MotoGP host,
  trimFomLegacy, trimSro) and the tests. No `off` flags remain. One-sport
  passes are gone from Fixtures' broadcasters except WNBA League Pass and
  EuroLeague TV; NHL is listed on DAZN, MLS on Apple TV. Play's whole "sets"
  market family went with badminton. Open bets on purged leagues were not
  refunded (the owner had none).
- **Fixtures is an add-on** like Orbit Class (kit APPS.match `related`, not in
  FAMILY): no 投注, no bets on cards, no 🎫, no follows/affinity shared with
  Play, no Play pins (the wallet's `pins` is gone from eco.js), Play's
  `#game=` link and slip snapshot for Fixtures removed. It reads only its own
  affinity (`affinity(wallet, now, ['match'])`).
- **Photos:** studio headshots only (kit photos.mjs: the league's own list
  (NBA.com, the Premier League), then FotMob's cutouts for every football
  league and cup (Shared-Data `sports/<league>/faces.json`, built nightly by
  mirror.mjs `fotmobPhotos`, gently: ~500 asks, 3 at a time), the feed's,
  ESPN by id or name, TheSportsDB cutouts); Wikipedia pictures never; device
  cache `fx.pics.v3` (a refused lookup isn't kept as "none").
  Play no longer gets photos.mjs.
- **Fixtures UI:** team pages rebuilt (hero, key-number strip, next game,
  賽程/戰績/陣容/排名 tabs) and available for NPB/KBO/CPBL, EuroLeague and K
  League (built from their own season: `ownTeam` in sheets.js); player pages
  in tabs (概況/數據/近期比賽/資料);
  race series in 賽事 as one card per weekend; a weekend's schedule as a
  timeline; leagues/sports with no games from two weeks back to two months on
  hidden (`checkActive`, `fx.active.v1`, 12 h); 我的轉播 off home; past
  seasons (歷年戰績, season picker) removed; Chinese names for every club the
  audit found (kit names.mjs).
- **Securities:** TradingView symbol icons for everything
  (`scripts/tv-logos.mjs` → `public/lib/tvlogos.mjs`; TW/HK flags from
  flagcdn); 定期定額 修改 edits in its row.
- Play's 紀錄 / Quadra 餘額 / home balance and Rewards' game removal were done
  by parallel agents this round: see their commits.

## Round in progress: the owner's list of 2026-10-01, and their second list (branch `claude/jolly-darwin-sjklht`)

Marks: [x] done, [~] done on the branch but not on `main` yet, [ ] to do.
Owner's working rules this round: push to `main` once a whole category is
done (not every change); be quick without losing quality; leave the ported
games for LAST; "when I say stop, commit everything and write the handoff".

Where things stand (2026-10-01, second session): everything below marked
[x] is on `main` in every repo. What's left is marked [ ].

The owner's second list (all [x] unless said):
- All apps: [x] the loading line follows real progress (boot.js counts the
  app's own files against last time's count on the device, then the steps
  the app names: the kit's sign-in at 80%, Fixtures' games and picks);
  [x] no pop-ups about updates (the v8/v10/v11/economy "what's new" notices
  were per app on a device, so every home-screen app showed them again;
  they're gone, and an update applies quietly, without the bar or the
  veil); [x] an iPad gets a phone's frame (`html.q-touch` from boot.js and
  quadra.mjs: no brand header, tabs at the bottom, the iOS top strip),
  only a computer's browser keeps the header; (unverified) the blur at an
  iPad's top can't be checked here: it should be gone with the phone's frame (the
  same strip that fixed it on iPhone); ask the owner.
- Securities: [x] logos from Wikidata (`scripts/brand-logos.mjs` writes
  `public/lib/brands.mjs`: 247 symbols, each checked by eye on a contact
  sheet; a fund shows its issuer's), FMP only outside Taiwan (its Taiwan
  images were photos), a Taiwan company without a logo shows its short
  name; [x] home: today's movers stacked on a phone; [x] the USD chart over
  匯率 removed.
- Fixtures: [x] F1 sheets fit a phone (tiles split "P1（133 次）", the
  race-by-race table's columns fixed); [x] an F1 team can be followed
  (`f1team: true`, id `f1team:<name>`; its races count as followed; in
  追蹤 with its last finishes and next session); [ ] more logos and real
  images everywhere: teams, leagues, people and F1 teams already have
  theirs; the broadcast services are text. Wikidata has logos for YouTube,
  DAZN, Disney+, Apple TV, UFC Fight Pass, MotoGP; none for ELTA, Hami
  Video, 緯來, 博斯 or MyVideo (their sites have no app icon either), so
  those need images from the owner, or stay text. Star and tick marks
  are gone from chips and follow buttons.
- Play: [x] taking a pick off the slip shows at once everywhere
  (`slipChanged`, `syncPicks` by `data-bet`).
- Orbit Class: [x] an iPad layout (sideways: dashboard and day side by
  side; upright: one wide column). On a computer it still shows its
  "phone app" QR page, by design.
- Preview tool: `--device ipad|pc`; Yahoo is fetched with a browser UA
  (it answers 429 otherwise); images are typed by their bytes.

Securities
- [x] 修改 on a 定期定額 plan scrolls to the plan's form (`scrollToPlanForm`).
- [x] 融資 margin calls as Taiwan's brokers run them (`callState`,
  `callDeadline`, `callNeed`, `payDown` in account.mjs;
  `tests/margincall.test.mjs`). The call is judged at the close under 130%.
  It is due at the close of the second business day after and is cancelled
  at 166% (`MARGIN_RESTORE`). It is met by paying cash (補繳), repaying or
  selling. At the deadline, if still under 130%, the margin holdings are
  sold. A forced sale happens only under 100%. No new 融資 is allowed while
  a call stands.
- [x] 統計分析 (`statsHtml`: 12-month P/L bars, win ring, best and worst
  trades, by market, costs), 交易明細 (one continuous list with line icons,
  a 30-day summary, chips that keep their scroll), 匯率 (a bank board with
  the USD hero), 資產 (composition bar, sort, compact rows), home (account
  card, logos), and real company logos (FMP images, with misses cached).
  Long explanatory lines were removed.
- [x] Taiwan's credit trading (lib/credit.mjs; tests/credit.test.mjs):
  - 信用帳戶: 3 months open, 10 trades and turnover of half the limit in the
    last year, proof of means (30%) above NT$500k; tiers 500k-5M, one for
    融資 and one for 融券. Accounts made before 2026-10-02
    (`CREDIT_RULES_AT`) count as having one at 500k (or what their turnover
    qualifies for). The card is in 換匯・融資 › 融資.
  - 融資 and 融券 run six months (`loanDue`, `shortDue` in replay); 展延
    (event `extend`) in the last month; past due, `closeOutPlan` sells or
    buys back (afterPrices).
  - 融券: 90% deposit and the sale money held (`shortDeposit`,
    `shortHeld`, counted in assets), 0.08% handling fee, no yearly fee.
    Other markets' shorts are unchanged (3% fee, 150% cover).
  - 現股當沖 sold first (`dayShort`): a year open and 10 trades; bought back
    for the account after the close. Half tax both ways.
  - After hours: orders 13:30-14:30 match once at 14:30 at the close
    (`order.after`).
  - Fees: the commission minimum applies after the discount.
  - Every trade shows its settlement date.

Play
- [x] Four tabs (home, 賽事, 彩券, 紀錄); the slip is a sheet
  (`#slip-sheet`, `openSlip`) over any tab.
- [x] Players' photos and NFL/NHL logos come from the kit.
- [x] 紀錄 has a summary; home has quick ways in.

Kit
- [x] `kit/boot.js`: one loading screen and an early version check.
- [x] `watchUpdates`: checks every 60 s and on focus. Updates reach every
  open tab through BroadcastChannel and apply at once unless the person is
  busy.
- [x] `keepStrips`: sideways chip, tab and date strips keep their scroll
  across redraws in every app (the "chip problem").
- [x] A modal sheet holds the page still behind it.
- [x] photos.mjs (ESPN's headshot by name, then Wikipedia) and NFL/NHL
  logos.
- [x] F1 drivers' and teams' formula1.com slugs (`page`), and Racing Bulls'
  aliases (`aka`).
- Sync with `node kit/sync.mjs` (every app's copy is committed).

Sports proxy (Worker)
- [x] YouTube channel feeds (`trimYoutube`).
- [x] F2/F3 sites (`trimFom`).
- [x] formula1.com `/en/(drivers|teams)/<slug>` (`trimF1Page`, which gives
  the page's DataGrids as label/value pairs).
- Tests for each are in tests/sports-proxy.test.mjs.

Fixtures
- [x] Date strip keeps the chosen day centred; the yellow bar is labelled
  占車隊積分 N%; the page doesn't scroll under a sheet.
- [x] Streaming services only (no cable or MOD).
- [x] YouTube is named for a game only when the league's channel has that
  game's video (`tvOf` and `ytVideoFor`; channel ids in broadcast.mjs).
- [x] F2 and F3 (their own calendars and sessions, on ELTA.tv MAX 5-8).
- [x] F1 Academy (the Worker's `trimFomLegacy`: /Racing-Series/Calendar and
  Results?raceid=n) and GT World Challenge Europe (`trimSro`: /calendar and
  /event/<id>/<slug>, the timetable's GMT column), both as F2's shape; F1 TV
  and YouTube (channels in broadcast.mjs).
- [x] F1 like the official app (lib/f1.mjs; tests/f1.test.mjs):
  - The driver sheet shows the season (position and points), Grand Prix and
    Sprint figures, career and birthplace from formula1.com.
  - A race-by-race table (from Jolpica) shows the grid, finish or
    retirement with its reason in Chinese, sprint result and points; each
    row opens that weekend.
  - The team sheet shows the drivers first, then Grand Prix and Sprint
    figures, a race-by-race table for both cars, history (車隊歷史) and
    profile.
  - A finished race or sprint shows the official result (`f1Field`): team
    (tappable), time or retirement, places gained, fastest lap and points.
- [x] Past seasons: 排名 has the last five seasons (`standings(league,
  season)`, a table league's champion on top) and team pages a 歷年戰績
  card. Not done: past winners of playoff leagues (MLB, NBA…), which ESPN's
  tables don't say.
- [x] 追蹤 rewritten (checked on screen, buttons styled). It shows
  followed teams with their last-5 dots, last result and next game (ESPN
  `teamSchedule`), players as cards, then leagues.
- [x] 直播 by service: a strip (全部 / 我的服務 / each service with
  counts, `state.liveSvc`), the lists filtered, no sport-emoji headers, the
  ELTA guide only under 全部 or ELTA.
- [x] One 我的設定 sheet (`openFollowEditor(focus)`; `openTvEditor` opens
  it at the services): sports in order, leagues, follows, services,
  commentary; no emoji or ✓ in chips.
- [x] Fewer emoji: sport icons off filters and search, 📺 off the tv line,
  session tags and the match info rows without icons. The first-run sport
  picker still has its icons (deliberately).
- [ ] One image source per entity (team logo vs casual picture).
- [x] MotoGP standings (W, podiums, points) and rider pages (`openRider`:
  profile, career in the class, every season); Formula E results
  (TheSportsDB `eventresults.php`).

Rewards (after Fixtures; ported games LAST)
- [x] Games fit the phone, a 遊戲列表 button at the end, one XP rate
  (`roundXp`), and sprite directions fixed.
- [x] 財富等級 by worth (worthOf: the pool and Securities' holdings), each
  level paying a one-time reward from the system (eco.js `RANKS`,
  `rankEntries` in the payday's entries, `eco:rank:<id>`; the kit's
  `WEALTH_RANKS` mirrors it): NT$1,000 to 30,000. 任務 shows the road with
  the rewards and 錢從哪裡來 (kit `moneySides`: the system gave, Quadra
  took, your own result). tools/economy.mjs doesn't model the level
  rewards yet: they're one-time and small next to the pay.
- [x] One 積分商店 sheet (`openShop(focus)`): the catalogue, items, word
  packs, avatars and frames; home has one card for it; 單字's unowned
  packs and 任務's level road open it.
- [~] Home and 任務 reworked as above; 單字 itself unchanged otherwise.
- [x] 說明 updated for every new mechanism (credit trading, level rewards,
  the shop, Fixtures' new pages).
- [~] LAST: port open-source games, integrated (Traditional Chinese, the
  round's start and end through Rewards, no foreign links). On `main`:
  dino (id `runner`), 2048 (`merge`, the classic one dropped from GAMES),
  Rembound's Match-3 (`match3`), Bubble Shooter (`bubbles`, new), iamkun's
  Tower (`stack`) and Jake Gordon's Breakout (`breakout`). A port takes the
  id of the home-made game it replaces (daily game, missions, bests carry
  over) and that game's arcade/<id>.js is deleted. Ported games pay up to
  50 (120 if 10+ minutes) at their "excellent" score (PORTED_LIST rows).
  Next: Jake Gordon's racer (`racer`; v4.final.html: no game over, so a
  2-minute round by distance, auto-accelerate, quadra.pad ◀ ▶, no music),
  Clumsy Bird (`flappy`, GPL), Hextris (new, GPL), simple-chess-ai (new,
  Apache). react-tetris has no licence: skip. Dead code of replaced games
  (classic merge's MERGE/mergeView, its STREAK entry) is still there.
  Removing the remaining home-made games only once ports exist for them.
  - In place: bridge.js, `portedStage`, and `PORTED_LIST`/`addPorted`.
  - Adapted already: ported/dino and ported/2048.
  - Candidates: Hextris, tower_game, react-tetris, rembound bubble/match-3,
    simple-chess-ai, jakesgordon racer/breakout, clumsy-bird, solitaire,
    minesweeper, sudoku.
  - Then remove the home-made games, keeping the word games, and check
    dailyGame, missions, badges and tests for removed ids.

## Photos, F1 team pages, Taiwan-only catalogue, MotoGP and Formula E (pushed to `main`)

Done:
- **Fixtures photos** (`lib/photos.mjs`, `personPic` in `ui.js`): a person's
  photo from the feed, ESPN's headshot by id (`espnHeadshot`: rpm, tennis,
  golf, mma, nba, mlb…), else Wikipedia's page image (batched, checked
  against the sport in the page's description, kept in `fx.pics.v1` on the
  device). Flags and initials only when nothing is found. Used in standings
  (F1 drivers no longer show flags), race orders, draws, cards, rosters,
  lineups, leaders, injuries, follows and search.
- **F1 team pages** (`openConstructor` in `sheets.js`): formula1.com's 2026
  white logos on the team's colour (kit `logos.mjs` F1_TEAMS `f1` slug and
  `zh` name; `f1Constructor` returns `logo`, `zh`, `drivers`), place,
  points, wins, podiums, both drivers with their share, next race, each
  weekend's finishes and points. Constructors show in Chinese.
- Tapping: leaders, injuries and lineups open the player; players without an
  ESPN page (table tennis, badminton, boxing) open `openPerson` (Wikipedia
  summary and their matches).
- **YouTube highlights** link on ended games and sessions (`highlightsUrl`:
  a YouTube search, the league's video first). **最新新聞 removed.**
- **Catalogue (kit `leagues.mjs`)**: `NO_TAIWAN` marks 27 leagues `off`
  (ACB, NBL, CBA, KBL, B.League, NCAAF, Eredivisie, Primeira, Belgium,
  Süper Lig, Saudi, Liga MX, Brasileirão, Argentina, Libertadores,
  Sudamericana, EFL Cup, Copa del Rey, ACL, Asian Cup, friendlies, Euro,
  Copa América, Club World Cup, rugby, cricket, snooker). Fixtures leaves
  them out entirely; Play keeps them in LEAGUES only so open bets settle
  (`onSale`, KAMBI_LEAGUES, EXTRA_LEAGUES and the sport groups skip them).
  Rights were checked by web search in October 2026: re-check yearly.
- **Formula E** (`data: 'tsdb'`, TheSportsDB league 4371, direct, CORS) and
  **MotoGP** (`data: 'motogp'`, api.motogp.pulselive.com through the proxy,
  host added to `sports-proxy-worker.js`) in Fixtures as race weekends
  (`parseMotoGpEvents/Sessions/Order`, `parseTsdbRaces`; tests in
  `tests/motorsport.test.mjs`). TheSportsDB's midnight times show as 時間待定.
- **Where to watch** (`broadcast.mjs`): new services YouTube, SOOP,
  Disney+, Volleyball TV, K League TV, MotoGP VideoPass. KBO free on SOOP,
  J.League/K League on their YouTube channels, WTT and BWF TV on YouTube,
  Formula E on Disney+ (practice on YouTube), MotoGP on 緯來, World Cup on
  ELTA, boxing on DAZN. A row shows a free stream when ELTA names no channel;
  the sheet links to it.
- **Play MotoGP race winner** (last commit): Kambi's "Winner" offer for the
  next Grand Prix (`nextKambiMotoRace`, `parseKambiMotoRace`), a board
  under F1 (`renderMoto`, section `#moto`, sport group `motogp`), legs of
  kind `moto` settled from MotoGP's results (`parseMotoGpRace`; void a
  week after with no race). Not yet seen on screen: check it on a phone
  (the proxy must be deployed with the MotoGP host first).

Next:
- Play: Formula E betting once Kambi prices it (season starts December);
  settle from TheSportsDB results or Formula E's site.
- Fixtures: MotoGP standings and rider pages (the API has
  `/results/standings`; riders' photos from `/riders/<uuid>`).
- Fixtures: Formula E results (TheSportsDB `eventresults.php`).
- Check the ELTA.tv app opener on a real iPhone (see the section below).

## Fixtures: F1 session badges, ELTA's commentary and the app (pushed to `main`)

- A race weekend's sessions (rows, picks, the sheet) carry a coloured badge:
  🏁 正賽 (accent, with a stripe on the row), ⏱️ 排位賽, ⚡ 衝刺賽, ⏱️ 衝刺排位賽.
- `lib/broadcast.mjs`: `eltaAudio(title, ch)` reads ELTA's titles — 原音 /
  英文解說 → 'en', 雙語 → 'dual', 副聲道現場原音 → 'venue', else 'zh';
  `adFree` when it says 無廣告 or it's a MAX channel (540–549). D-LIVE
  (delayed) and "Kids" showings are dropped. 980–989 are MOD's own channels
  (no ELTA.tv page). `channelRank` sorts a game's channels: the person's
  commentary (`prefs.audio`, 'en' by default, set in the TV sheet), then no
  ads, so MAX 原音 → MAX 中文 → 體育台 for F1.
- The 📺 line uses short names (MAX5台, 愛爾達2台) with an audio tag, the
  person's kind highlighted; the sheet's card says 原音・無廣告 · time · where.
- 觀看 on a phone opens `eltatv://live/<ch>` (ELTA's own appRedirect.js
  mapping; its site only bounces to the app once per 12 h, which is why it
  "sometimes" opened). Android uses an intent with the web page as fallback.

## Fixtures: small-hours big games, bets in the picks (pushed to `main`)

- The night rule (picks are 05:00-24:00 Taipei; `inPickDay`) dropped every
  game starting 00:00-05:00, an MLB wild-card Game 3 at 02:00 included.
  Now `nightWorthy` (picks.mjs `bigGame`: stage post/final/playin or a
  final/series/play-off note; a followed team's; one bet on in Play) keeps
  it on its own calendar day, at its hour.
- Games with open Play slips (`openBetLegs`, the wallet's snap) are in the
  picks: `dayPlan(..., { keep })` adds them on top of the n picks (reason
  `bet`, `bet: true`, the pick on the card via `pickCard`'s `bets`), never
  pushing a pick out, never stopping the fallback or the next-day jump
  (`ownPicks`). Day chips with bets show 🎫 (`betDays`). There's no
  separate 你的投注 list: `lib/bets.mjs` finds each leg's game by Play's id
  or, for a leg bet in play (`g` 'live'), by Play's league (`sp`) and start
  time; a league the day's read didn't bring is read for it (`loadBets`,
  `slot.betEvents`, only those games used).
- **Every bet, finished ones and championships** (Fixtures `lib/bets.mjs`,
  tests/bets.test.mjs; Play's snap.odds now also has `done`, slips settled
  in the last 8 days with `st`, and futures legs carry `fk` market and `tm`
  team): `legEvent` finds a game by id or league+start (names compared in
  any script; two games at once and no name match → no guess), an F1 bet
  its session (nearest within 3 h), a tennis/fight bet the tournament or
  card running then. Settled: only what was played shows, with ✓/✗; a
  settled championship shows nothing. `betsByEvent` keys games by
  league:id, so one game is one card with every bet on it.
- Championship picks (`TITLE_MARKETS`, all 18 Play markets): play-offs
  (`seriesStakes`: game k can decide a best-of-n when someone can reach the
  wins by then, from the series as it stands; next game exact; title round
  'title'; AL/NL pennants ignore the World Series), later rounds as if the
  team gets there (`placeholder` slots, `bracketOf` sides from the
  standings' group names, `knockedOut` from `playoffRun`), knockouts
  (`knockoutStakes`, real games only), league tables (`tableStakes`: could
  end title hopes or settle them) and F1 (`f1Stakes`, 25/43 a weekend, +8/15
  with a sprint). Loaded on demand by app.js `loadTitleData`; the night
  rule keeps any event a bet points to (`betOn`).
- Days other than today read tennis, golf, racing and fight leagues by
  ESPN's dated page (`scoreboard(k, dates)`), not the season's (19-26 MB
  for ATP, WTA, PGA: it hung the page). `sportDays` still reads seasons.

## v11: a points catalogue, Plus perks reviewed, loans counted once (pushed to `main`)

- **積分兌換** (kit `CATALOG`, `catalogCost/Limit/Entry/Tokens`,
  `catalogPlusMonth`, `CATALOG_BETS`): Rewards' Home redeems points into
  Quadra's own products, entries `vocab:xs:<item>:<key>` (kind `redeem`,
  amount 0, points in the note). The Worker's `REWARDS_XP` has a member's
  price (90%) as the floor; `tests/kit.test.mjs` checks they match.
  - `bet100` / `bet500`: Play free bet NT$100 / 500 for 5,000 / 22,000 XP,
    NT$1,000 of face a Taipei month; the kit's `freeBets` returns them, so
    Play's slip takes them like any token (label 積分兌換), spent as
    `odds:fb-<token id>`.
  - `fee`: up to NT$100 off the next Securities fill with commission
    (`fillOrder`, `fill.voucher`/`voucherOff`, the rest lost), 4,000 XP, 30
    days, 3 a month. The ticket shows it (`ticketVoucher`).
  - `td`: +0.5% on one new 定存 of up to NT$100,000, first term only
    (early closing pays the posted rate, roll-over drops it), 12,000 XP, 30
    days, 1 a month (`openDeposit` `bonus`, 理財's checkbox).
  - `plus`: a month of Plus for 20,000 XP, once a calendar quarter, only
    after the free month; this month, or next when this one is held. The
    Worker's `plusPointsEntries` (in `paydayEntries`, before renewal) writes
    `eco:plus:<month>` amount 0 note `points`, enforcing all of that. A
    points month is no payment: `plusLapsed` ignores it (eco.js and kit), so
    it never revives a lapsed subscription.
  - Securities marks spent vouchers in the wallet as `stock:xs-<token id>`
    (amount 0) so Rewards' held counts are right (`usedVouchers`).
- **Plus perks (v11):** word packs no longer half price (`packShare` 1; the
  Worker's `REWARDS_SHOP` keeps the old floor for purchases still in a
  device's outbox); added catalogue 9折 (`PLUS.vocab.catalog`), 定存 +0.1%
  (`PLUS.stock.tdBonus`, `depositRate`) and a 20% lending cut
  (`PLUS.stock.lendCut`, the `lend` event's `cutRate`, `lendFee`). Help,
  `plusPerks`, the Plus sheet and the one-time notice `quadra.seen.v11`
  (`v11Notice`, accounts made before 2026-10-03 Taipei) say so.
- Model (`node tools/economy.mjs`, v11, PEOPLE's `cat*`): the house still
  nets a profit on everyone; catalogue costs are a free bet's expected
  return, a voucher capped at the commission there is, a member's Plus
  month at the fee forgone.
- **Loans counted once (Securities):** the wallet snap's `stock.cash` was
  own cash less every loan while `holdings` were net of the same loans, so
  a loan came off twice (an owner's account showed −NT$46,687 in Play with
  NT$22 of real cash). Now `stock.cash` is the cash as it is; loans live in
  holdings and Securities' own margin checks. 融資 buys from before
  2026-10-01 10:49 Taipei borrowed the shortfall as plain `borrow:` loans;
  `linkOldLoans` (in `afterPrices`) ties each, once, to the buy placed
  within 5 minutes after it (a `link` event dated when made, newest first,
  capped by what's owed and the shares' cost, loans already paid off left
  alone), so selling repays first and a margin call sees them. (Removed
  2026-10-01 with the owner's reset: no account has those loans now.)
- Open question for the owner: October's overdraft interest (`eco:od:2026-10`)
  was charged on balances that double-counted loans; a refund would have
  to be a Worker entry. Not done.

Rules: push every change to `main` in every repo; `npm test` in each (Orbit
also `npx eslint .`, after `npm ci` in a fresh container); edit the kit only
in `Shared-Proxy/kit/` and `node kit/sync.mjs`; commits end with the
Co-Authored-By and Claude-Session lines; `tools/preview.mjs <app> --store
quadra.seen.v8=1 --store quadra.seen.v10=1 --store quadra.seen.v11=1` for
screenshots (Yahoo often answers 429 for Securities' prices).
## Ultra realistic, v10: a fixed salary, savings, points that expire (pushed to `main`)

- **Pay is fixed** (eco.js `PAY_MONTH`, kit `ECONOMY.monthly`): NT$6,000 on
  the 1st of every Taiwan month for every account, like a salary; back pay
  for missed months as before. v7-v9 paid 8,000 / 4,000 / 1,500 / 500 by
  worth, which paid saving less and losing more. `payFor()`/`paydayFor()`
  keep their names and ignore worth; `ECONOMY.payTiers`/`PAY_TIERS` are
  gone. Text says 月薪/薪水 (“pay”) instead of 津貼.
- Model (`node tools/economy.mjs`, v10): a regular bettor −NT$1.9k a month,
  an investor +3.9k, a saver +5.4k; 4,000 or 5,000 broke a regular within a
  year.
- **Securities › 換匯・融資 › 理財** (`lib/savings.mjs` has the terms;
  account.mjs the events):
  - **定存:** NT$10,000+, 1/3/6/9/12 months at Bank of Taiwan's posted fixed
    rates (1.23-1.72%), events `td` and `tdend`. Early closing pays nothing
    under a month, else 80% of the rate for the longest term held, for the
    days held. Optional roll-over (principal at the then-posted rate,
    interest paid out). Matured deposits are closed (dated at maturity) by
    `matureDeposits` in `afterPrices`. In net worth (`savedTWD`), not in
    margin assets; they leave the shared cash while locked.
  - **借券出借:** whole lots (1,000) of settled TW stocks/ETFs not bought on
    margin; fee 1.2% / 0.6% a year on the value when lent, the broker keeps
    30%. Events `lend`, `recall` (with `back`, 3 business days on) and
    `lendpay` (dated `back`, so replay pays it then). Lent shares are out of
    `available`, so they can't be sold; contracts end by themselves after
    180 days (`matureLending`).
  - Interest or a fee over NT$20,000 at once: 10% withheld, 2.11% NHI
    (`incomeTaxes`).
  - A default breaks every deposit (bank set-off, early rate) and recalls
    lent shares (`recallAll`); a missed margin call or liquidation recalls
    too. The 7% penalty is charged once per overdraft now
    (`defaultAt >= od.since`), later rounds only sell. Forced-sale plans skip
    lent shares.
- **Points expire** (kit `xpLots`, `xpBalance(wallet, now)`, `xpExpiring`):
  each Taipei month's points at the end of the same month a year later,
  oldest spent first; points from before v7 count from v7. The level
  (`xpEarned`) never drops. Rewards' level card and the account sheet warn
  60 days ahead.
- **Plus like a real subscription:** billed every month while on, opened or
  not (months away charged on return, after their pay; yearly by the year).
  A charge the pool can't cover writes `eco:plusfail:<month>` (amount 0)
  and the membership lapses (`plusLapsed`, eco.js and kit; `plusRenewing`
  is false) until joined again; no retry. The kit notifies once
  (`quadra.seen.plusfail`). The sheet's fine print: auto-charge, failure,
  no refunds, 5% VAT included. Free bets (Play `FREE_MIN_ODDS` 1.5, every
  pick; `placeFreeSlip` refuses with `freeOdds`); no cash out, 7 days, as
  before.
- One-time notice `quadra.seen.v10` (`v10Notice`) for accounts made before
  2026-10-02 Taipei.
## Slower levels, more for points, confirm before buying (pushed to `main`)

- **融資 as a broker does it** (Securities): no cash loans. A buy can be
  融資 (`placeOrder` `margin`, ticket 現股/融資): it holds only one's own part,
  and on filling lends `collateralRate` of it (`loan:<order>` borrow event
  with the symbol; the position's `financed`). Selling repays that share of
  it first (`repay:<order>`, `fill.repaid`). Loan values: Taiwan 60% / OTC
  50%, Reg T 50% elsewhere, none on A-shares, India, crypto, funds, gold,
  currencies; government bonds 90%, corporate 70%. Interest is added to the
  loan (never charged to cash). The loans tab only repays.
- **Overdraft collected like 違約交割:** NT$ cash below zero starts
  `account.od.since`; after OD_GRACE (2 days) Securities sells holdings for
  it (coverPlan, market orders `forced` + `cover`, which don't trigger the
  loans' repayAll). Covered, `od` goes.
  Past the deadline it's a default: `penaltyEvent` (7% 違約金, event type
  `penalty`), `account.defaultAt`, and `defaulted()` blocks 融資 and short
  selling for DEFAULT_BAN (5 years). A margin call (under 130%) not met in
  CALL_GRACE (2 days, `account.call.since`) sells every holding bought on
  margin (`callPlan`, 斷頭); under 115% it's liquidated at once as before.

- **Securities' cash for the other apps** (snap `stock.cash`) is its own NT$
  less what it owes on loans: borrowed money stays for trading, never bets
  in Play or covers an overdraft. Margin itself: collateral 0.6 of stock
  (cash none), so borrow → buy → borrow converges at 1.5× own money (2.5×
  exposure, Taiwan's 60%). 定期定額 can be changed (修改: amount and day,
  `state.planEdit`, saved over the plan by `setPlan`).

- **Streak = 5 missions a day** (kit `STREAK.missions` 5, `bonusCounts` 2,
  `missionDays`): of the six daily ones three are in the other apps, so a
  kept day always goes through them; the bonus ones that spend money (now
  40–60 XP) count too, two a day at most: the easy way, never a must.

- **Levels** (kit `xpForLevel`): 100·(L−1)²: Lv 10 at 8,100, 20 at 36,100,
  50 at 240,100 (about a year of daily play). **Daily soft cap**
  (`ECONOMY.dailyXp`, Rewards `dampXp`/`capStage`): words and games give the
  first 600 XP a day in full, the next 600 at half, then a tenth (×Plus,
  streak and ×2 boost move the steps); missions, weekly goals and the daily
  challenge aren't counted. Home's level card shows where today stands.
- **Points buy more:** frames (kit `FRAMES`, setting `frame`, `q-framed
  q-frame-<id>` on the account button; bronze Lv 10, legend Lv 40, mythic
  Lv 50, five bought 2,000–30,000 XP), a daily mission swap (100 XP, 2 a
  day, `vocab:xs:reroll:<day>:<mission>`, `dailyMissionIds(day, swapped)`),
  yesterday bought back for the streak (1,500 XP, when a streak of 3+ broke
  and no card is held, `vocab:xs:repair:<day>`, counted by `activeDaySet`).
  The Worker's `REWARDS_XP` has `frame`, `reroll`, `repair`.
- **Every purchase asks first** (kit `ask`): Play bets (cost and the most it
  pays), lottery tickets, scratch cards; Securities orders, exchanges,
  loans, monthly plans; joining Plus (kit). Rewards already did.
- **Prices at the moment of buying:** a Securities order goes in at once
  as a 委託單 held for a fresh price (`placeOrder` `fresh` → `waitFresh`;
  `processOrders` fills it only at a quote with `got` after it, `fetchQuotes`
  stamps `got`); `atFreshPrice` reads the quote straight away (a few tries),
  the usual refresh after that. Play's slip redraws with each board refresh
  and marks odds that moved since the pick was added (`pickedOdds`, ▲/▼ and
  the old figure); placing is one tap at the odds now, stopped only by a
  pick closed or started.
- **Free bet as a cut** (Play `placeFreeSlip`, `freeValue`): more can go on
  top from the balance; a win pays all but the free part's stake.
- **Words:** smart mode never asks a flash card; letters questions have no
  sound (it made them dictation) and give the first letter (two for 8+).
- **Fixtures 首頁 你的投注:** the day's games with open Play slips
  (`playGameId` = the slip leg's `g`), live, with the pick under each, above
  正在進行 (and not repeated there). Baseball's live line: count and
  batter vs pitcher on a line each.
- Play's 我的彩券 has no count; VIP explained as rows; Securities' margin
  gauge labels sit either side of their ticks.
- `tools/preview.mjs --snap '{json}'`: the wallet's snap to start with.

## Streak by missions, mastery over days, fair cash out (pushed to `main`)

- **Streak = 3 daily missions** (kit `STREAK.missions`, `missionDays`,
  `activeDaySet`): from `STREAK.from` (2026-10-02) a day counts when 3 of
  that day's daily missions were claimed (`vocab:m:<day>:<id>`, the bonus ids
  in `STREAK.bonus` aside) or a card covered it; earlier days keep the old
  rule (any practice or game). Rewards' `streakToday` drives the
  「領取 3 個每日任務保住連續紀錄 · n/3」 line (任務 and home), the 20:00
  notices (→ #missions) and push.
- **Missions** (Rewards `MISSIONS`, `dailyMissionIds`): six a day from a pool,
  same for everyone, 3 in Rewards (words20/words50, master3, hard10 = right
  by ear/letters/dictation, perfect = a 10+ round without a miss, game1/games3,
  challenge) and 3 elsewhere (quotes, match/matches3, orbit, tour), at most
  one of a `group`. Nothing that's a personal choice (watchlist, follows).
  Bonus missions (invest, parlay3, scratch, lotto) spend money: always
  shown in their own section, never count for the streak. Fixtures' `open`
  now counts each match once a day (`matches3`); Play's scratch card no
  longer also counts as `lottery`.
- **Weekly:** `days5` = days kept with missions; all four claimed → a
  protection card (Rewards `weeklyCards`, in `freezes().granted`).
- **Words:** a word moves up one box a day at most (`grade`), so mastery
  comes from the record over days: known-at-first-sight → box 3 due
  tomorrow, right then → mastered; the in-round confirm is gone. Rounds
  take box-3 due words first. `BOX_DAYS` 0,0,1,1,5,14. Smart mode
  (`smartType(p, random, word, used)`) picks from the kinds that suit the
  box the one least used this round, so a round has all six (flash cards
  weighted ×4, i.e. rarer). The voice picker (單字發音) is gone: recordings,
  the device's best voice only as the fallback.
- **Play cash out** (`cashOutValue(slip, chances)`): weighed by the board's
  fair chance (`fairChance`, margin out), not 1 / odds (that gave the margin
  back: cashing out beat holding, and small odds moves were a profit, more
  with Plus's 2%). Untouched, it's below the held worth; no `fairChance` →
  1 / odds less 10%.

## Missions that count, and a streak that matters (pushed to `main`)

- **Lost mission steps:** each app built its `act:<app>` counts from its copy
  of the wallet, so two steps in a row (Play's `bet` then `parlay`, the
  lottery's `lottery` then `scratch`) raced and the Worker kept only one
  (same millisecond: whichever it read last). The kit's `activityPatch` now
  keeps the day's counts on the device (`quadra.act.<app>`), merges by the
  larger of each, and gives each write a newer `t`. A free bet's parlay
  always went through `track('parlay')`; it was this race.
- **Missions, concrete:** Securities `invest` counts an order placed
  (`trade`; watching no longer counts); `quotes` (new) three different stocks
  opened (`view`, once a stock a day, Securities `openDetail`) replaces the
  daily 定期定額 (it counted only a symbol that never had a plan); Fixtures
  `match` counts a match opened (`open`; following no longer counts).
  Texts say exactly what to do.
- **Streak** (kit `STREAK`, `activeDaySet`, `streakOf`, `longestStreakOf`,
  `streakBonus`, `streakCards`): any word practice (flash cards and misses
  too: a batch is written with 0 points) or finished game (0 points too)
  counts; a protection card covers a day. Points ×(1 + 2% a day, up to +30%)
  (Rewards `xpRate`); 7, 30, 100 days (longest ever) each unlock an avatar
  (🐯 🦅 🏆) and a protection card, with a pop-up once. Home's level card
  shows it; 任務 › 等級與頭像 has the streak road.

## Fixtures: one date strip (pushed to `main`)

- 賽事 uses 首頁's `dateStrip` (weekday and date chips, 📅 for any day,
  growing as it's scrolled) instead of its own chips with counts and ‹ ›:
  `only` the league's game days, its own `range` per league (`sc.range`),
  `grow` → `growScores` (sc.extra + 1, read without redrawing). A day picked
  that isn't read yet (an ESPN league's) is read on its own
  (`pickScoresDay`). `loadScores` is `fetchScores` + `applyScores` now.

## Round: more for points, and tidier pop-ups (all repos, pushed to `main`)

- **Avatars** (kit `AVATARS`, `avatarOwned`, `avatarOf`): the account button in
  every app wears the one chosen (wallet setting `avatar`, `{ id }`); level
  ones at 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 50, eight bought with points (300-5,000 XP,
  `vocab:xs:avatar:<id>`, the Worker's `REWARDS_XP.avatar`, which also refuses
  buying a level one), ✦ for Plus members. Not owned any more → the person.
- **Level rewards:** a streak card at levels 5, 15, 25… (`levelCards`, added
  to Rewards' `freezes().granted`); a level-up pop-up once per device with
  what the level brought (`checkLevelUp`).
- **Rewards 任務 › 等級與頭像:** the next four levels that bring something
  and the avatar grid (wear, the level it needs, its price, or Plus); the
  home level card opens it.
- **Pop-ups:** the kit's `ask`/`tell` take `points` (short rows: icon, bold
  line, quiet line); the update notice and stop-renewing dialog use them.
  The Plus sheet shows a member's fee, months and total as three figures.
  Money and points prices are two pills under each shop item.

## Round: v9, Securities earns a little more (realistically) and Plus keeps members (all repos, pushed to `main`)

- **Why Play earns and Securities doesn't:** per investor a month (the model's
  NT$40,000, ~70% invested, NT$50,000 traded) Securities keeps ~143 commission
  and ~157 sell tax and exchange fees (a sink like any other in play money),
  but the market pays holdings ~7% a year (~163) and cash earns 0.8%: net
  about +130, against ~7,900 from a regular bettor. That's realistic: a
  broker keeps ~0.3% of turnover, a sportsbook 5-15% of stakes.
- **Mutual funds** now pay a 1% subscription fee (申購手續費, `FUND_FEE` in
  `markets.mjs`, a Taiwan online fund platform's discounted rate; Plus's
  2.8折 applies) and nothing to redeem, instead of the US stock commission.
- **Plus cash interest** is 2% on the first NT$100,000 only (kit
  `PLUS.stock.cashCap`, like a Taiwan digital bank's high-interest tier);
  0.8% on the rest.
- **Plus at full use:** typical members cost about the fee (v8 table). The most
  a bettor can take: a free bet staked on long odds returns up to ~86% of its
  face (1 − the cut), about NT$750 a month, plus two cards (NT$600 only if
  they'd have bought them) and ≤ NT$100 of cash interest. A heavy trader saves
  72% of commission with no cap (as real brokers' discounts), but still pays
  the rest and the 0.3% sell tax, so still earns the house money, just less.
  Light users earn the house the most.
- **Keeping members** (kit): the Plus sheet shows the fee, this month's
  returns (free bets, cards at shop price, boosts), the month count and the
  total since joining (`plusReturns({ all })`, `plusTenure`); a banner when
  the weekly free bet arrives and three days before any renewal, the free
  month included, with how to stop (`plusNotices`, notice kind `plus`);
  stopping is one confirmation that states what Plus gave back and what
  stays and stops; Rewards badges at 3, 6 and 12 Plus months. No dark
  patterns: cancelling stays under 管理會員, and every charge is announced.

## Round: v8, points with a purpose and a Plus worth paying for (all repos, pushed to `main`)

v7's Plus (NT$990) gave every kind of member less than its fee, so nobody
would pay; points had no use. Now:

- **Levels and titles** (kit `xpLevel`, `xpEarned`, `xpBalance`): level L
  from 50·L·(L−1) XP (2 at 100, 5 at 1,000, 10 at 4,500, 20 at 19,000),
  titles 新手 Rookie → 神話 Mythic. On Rewards' home (with the progress to
  the next level) and every app's account sheet.
- **Points buy things** in Rewards (shop.mjs `redeemEntry`): a streak card
  600 XP, word points ×2 for 30 minutes 300 XP, packs 8,000 / 12,000 /
  16,000 XP, next to the money price. Entries `vocab:xs:<item>:<key>`, kind
  `redeem`, amount 0, the points in the note; the Worker drops one priced
  under `REWARDS_XP` (the app checks the balance; like money, the Worker
  doesn't). Spending lowers `xpBalance`, never the level.
- **Plus v8** (`tools/economy.mjs` PLUS_V8, the v8 rows): NT$490 a month /
  4,900 a year; a NT$200 free bet every Monday (was 100); two streak cards a
  month (was one); Rewards points ×1.5; packs half price; Securities perks
  and cash out as before; the daily +10% lift is gone (`PLUS.odds.lift: 0`,
  Play hides its row). Face value to a bettor about NT$1,470 a month (3×
  the fee); expected cost to the house NT$340-690, so the house earns about
  the same from a member as from a non-member (casual +100, regular +79,
  high roller +100, investor −3, heavy bettor −200 from cards it no longer
  sells, words only +149).
- **The free first month** (unchanged: the rest of the month you first
  join) costs the house what the perks cost without the fee: NT$340-690 for
  a full month, less mid-month.
- The one-time notice is now `quadra.seen.v8` (v8Notice) with all of it.

## Round: v7, Rewards pays points, the only money is Quadra's (all repos, pushed to `main`)

The owner asked that Rewards stop paying money: the opening money and the
monthly allowance are the only money Quadra gives (a mechanism for the
economy, not a payout), and every product must earn the house money
without them (`node tools/economy.mjs`, the v7 rows and the house table).

- **Rewards gives points (XP), never NT$:** words, games, missions, weekly
  goals and the daily challenge write entries with `amount: 0` and `xp`
  (`lib/earn.mjs`: `xpOf`, `xpToday`, `xpAllTime`, `xpText`); no daily caps.
  Old paid entries count as points (`xpOf` falls back to the amount), so
  streaks, weekly goals and badges carry on. The three Play/Securities
  missions give points instead of free bets. Outbox entries still waiting
  with an amount become points on load. The shop is the only money Rewards
  moves (streak card 300, word points ×2 150, packs).
- **Worker (`eco.js cleanEntry`):** drops a new `vocab` entry with a positive
  amount or a `vocab:fb:` id; keeps `xp` (≤ 10,000) on `vocab` entries.
  Nothing already stored changes.
- **Allowance (v7):** 8,000 / 4,000 / 1,500 / 500 by worth (was 6,000 /
  3,000 / 1,500 / 500), kit `ECONOMY.payTiers` = `eco.js PAY_TIERS` (tested
  together). A regular bettor levels out near NT$32,000; casual players and
  word learners grow slowly into the lower tiers; heavy bettors drain.
- **Plus (v7):** NT$990 a month / 9,900 a year (was 390 / 3,900); the parlay
  boost is no longer doubled (`PLUS.odds.boost: 1`, Play hides the Plus
  ladder hint), the daily +10% lift covers a slip up to NT$500 (was 1,000),
  no extra word pay, packs half price for members instead of included
  (`PLUS.vocab.packShare`; the Worker's `REWARDS_SHOP` minimums already
  were half). Members' old slips keep their stored `boost`. The house now
  earns more from every kind of member than from the same non-member.
- **Kit:** a one-time notice (`quadra.seen.v7`) for accounts made before
  2026-10-01 Taiwan (`V7_AT`) explains the change; the statement skips
  zero-amount entries (points, tokens); Rewards' role reads 積分、目標與說明.
- **House per user a month, at NT$40,000, excluding the allowance** (v7
  model): casual +565 (Plus +1,258), regular +7,871 (+7,941), high roller
  +61,601 (+62,396), investor +2,114 (+2,211), heavy bettor +11,288
  (+11,378), words only +383 (+1,331). Promotions stay 2-13% of the gaming
  take for bettors.
- Not changed: back pay for months nobody opened an app (`paydayEntries`
  pays every missed month on return); VIP cashback; cash interest.

## Done in the round before

- **Sell every game, one reach, one cut (Play + Fixtures):** Play sells every
  league's games up to 14 days out (`SOLD_DAYS` in `kit/leagues.mjs`, the
  same for all leagues and sources; Fixtures' 投注 uses it too, so every ESPN
  game in reach gets 投注). A game no bookmaker prices yet (NBA preseason, a
  game DraftKings hasn't posted) is priced by the house (`Quadra-Play/public/
  lib/house.mjs`: ESPN standings, last season regressed, log5 plus home edge,
  soccer's draw, preseason pulled halfway to even); DraftKings' line replaces
  it once posted. Past the daily pages, ESPN's month pages (`dates=YYYYMM`)
  fill the second week. The house cut is one rule now (`rules.mjs houseCut`):
  the lottery's measured cut per kind of market, no league-tier, source-gap,
  line-step or source-specific extras; one win K (`K_WIN`, 1.158), so prices
  stay close to 運彩's.
- **CPBL empty on the live proxy (fixed on the device):** cpbl.com.tw
  refuses Cloudflare (403; its /schedule page also 404s/loops from anywhere
  now) and TheSportsDB rate-limits the Worker (429), so every CPBL month came
  back as 0 games and was cached as if the league had none (Fixtures stuck on
  August, Play only Kambi's day). The Worker now answers 502 with the reasons
  (never cached); the kit's `asiaMonth` then reads TheSportsDB's day lists
  straight from the device (CORS open), two weeks back to two weeks ahead
  (`tsdbDays`, `parseTsdbDay`, shared with the Worker). Past months beyond
  that stay empty until a server-side source works again.
- **Every sport (Kambi leagues too):** Play sells every game on a Kambi
  league's own schedule (`Quadra-Play/public/lib/schedules.mjs`): Asian
  baseball's month lists (strength from this season's results; settled from
  the lists, final-score markets only via `scoreOnly`), ESPN's UFC cards
  (records), tennis draws (ranking points, each tour's singles), and every match in Kambi's list for the
  rest (priced or not; the 16-match cap is gone). Kambi's price replaces the
  house's once posted (`pricedByKambi`). Fixtures' 投注 no longer reads
  Kambi: every game of every league Play sells, within `SOLD_DAYS`.

- **Data-loss fix (critical):** the kit's `q.start()` returned the session
  instead of the first reply, so every app thought the pass was empty and
  saved over it. Fixed; apps also refuse to save over a copy they can't
  read. Play rebuilds lost slips from the wallet (`recoverFromWallet`) and
  merges the old on-device copies; Securities merges its old device copy.
- **Pass security (kit v3 + eco.js):** session-only `/eco`; no pass stored
  on devices (refresh token + account id); device codes (`pair-create` /
  `pair-redeem`); sealed handoff without the pass; rotate and
  sign-out-everywhere from the session; transfers, betting limit, legacy
  routes (`/sync`, `/vocab-sync`, `/odds-sync`, `/stock-sync`, `/vocab-ai`)
  and legacy merges removed; `/kambi` needs a session.
- **Firestore cleaned** with `eco-admin.js` (5 legacy docs removed, one
  wallet tidied). `ADMIN_TOKEN_HASH` is empty (off); to run again, put the
  SHA-256 of a new random token there, deploy, POST
  `{ op: 'admin', token, action: 'scan' | 'clean' }`, then clear it again.
- **Notifications** in the kit (`notify`, in-app banner + system notices
  once allowed in the account sheet); used by Fixtures (followed team
  starts/ends) and Play (slip settled, ticket won). Every app's `sw.js`
  handles notification taps.
- **Orbit Class:** Quadra Pass is the only save; follow and old sync-code
  merge removed; share keys give a copy; panel no longer resets while
  typing; restyled; daily activity (`act:orbit`) feeds a Rewards mission.
  The user's old schedule was merged into their pass (done).
- **Fixtures:** follow sports in priority order, leagues, teams; Today's
  picks (`lib/picks.mjs`); Following tab (replaced News); date strip shows
  only game days; reorganised match sheets. Follows are copied to the
  wallet setting `follow:match` for Play.
- **Play:** new home (header card, follows from Fixtures, logos), lottery
  (cards with quick pick, basket buying, grouped tickets), notices.
- **Rewards:** Orbit mission; all help text updated.

## Done in the next round

- **Securities' 資產 page:** allocation ring (total inside, by kind /
  currency / market), holding rows with today's price line and a weight bar,
  a cash card (spendable total, held for orders, settling, cash interest
  rate, wallets), an income card (dividends, coupons and cash interest over
  12 months and this year, yield on holdings, top payers, dividends on the
  way; `incomeSummary` in `lib/account.mjs`, `donut` / `miniBars` in
  `lib/chart.mjs`), tidier "where the money came from" rows. Its own
  notification setting is gone: price alerts and filled orders use the
  kit's `notify` and the account sheet's toggle.
- **Rewards:** four new games (speed match, hangman, colour memory, mini
  sudoku; 8 in all, in "word games" and "a break from words"), a daily
  challenge (`dailyGame`, first paid round adds NT$10-40 by days in a row,
  inside the games' cap), weekly goals (paid as missions), badges, your
  bests (wallet setting `bests:vocab`), word of the day on home. Notices:
  a mission or weekly goal newly ready to claim, a streak ending tonight.
- **Orbit Class:** a notice five minutes before each class
  (`classStartingSoon`).
- `kit/sync.mjs` pointed at `Quadra-Sportsbook` (now Quadra-Play), so it
  skipped Play; fixed.
- **Polish:** every tab of every app checked at 360px (no sideways scroll);
  Securities' rates board no longer breaks currency names mid-word.

## Then

- Everything pushed to `main`.
- **Orbit Class data loss fixed:** sync used to push the device's copy
  before pulling, so a device left open with an older schedule overwrote
  the newer one (on coming back, becoming the live app, or a style save).
  Now: pull first; a device uploads only its own saved edits and only while
  the pass still holds the copy it last saw; otherwise the newer copy wins
  and the local change is set aside (`orbitSetAside`). Tests:
  `test/quadra-sync-newer.test.js` (fail on the old code).
- **Orbit Class is phone-only:** a computer gets `phoneOnlyGate` (kit) with
  a QR code (`qrcode-generator`) and the steps.
- **No browser pop-ups left:** the kit's `ask` / `tell` (styled confirm and
  alert) replace every `confirm` / `alert` (account sheet, Securities'
  plan stop, Play's scratch-card funds).

## Ideas for later

- Rewards: word ladder, reaction game, a shared leaderboard (needs the
  Worker).

## Notes

- Set the `ECO_TOKEN_SECRET` repo secret on Shared-Proxy to turn on the
  data proxy's token check (without it, `/sports-proxy` doesn't check
  tokens; `/eco` derives a key from the Firebase key).
- One old test pass from an earlier session may still exist (harmless).
- Never commit anyone's pass or codes into a repo.

## And then

- **Account recovery (done):** a pass lost to the new-pass screen opening
  behind the account sheet was found with `eco-admin.js`'s `wallets` and
  `device-code` actions (admin switched off again: `ADMIN_TOKEN_HASH` empty).
  The kit now closes the sheet first, shows the new pass as a full-screen
  modal dialog, and only closes it once its last 5 characters are typed
  back. A pasted pass with its dash (11 characters) no longer loses a
  character (no maxlength on the sign-in box).
- **Kit:** each notice kind has its own switch (`NOTICE_KINDS`, `kindOn`);
  no double-tap zoom; the page is locked behind the loading screen; apps
  no longer use `viewport-fit=cover` (iOS blurred what scrolled under the
  status bar).
- **Play:** lost never-settled slips refunded after 3 days (`refundLost`);
  lottery can't overspend a pool below zero; slips filed by the day their
  games were played; quick picks only fill the list; 我的彩券 lives in 紀錄;
  統計分析 remade (`stats-ui.js`); opens right after the main board; scratch
  cards redone; tab bar keeps room for the home indicator.
- **Rewards:** 35 arcade games (`lib/arcade.mjs`, `public/arcade/`), a new
  games list (search, categories, favourites, recent), how-to-play cards.
- **Fixtures:** F1 drivers' and constructors' tables; followed leagues
  weigh 0.6 in today's picks.
- **Orbit Class:** the dashboard title is fitted once it's on screen.
- Not verifiable here (no real phone): the status-bar blur fix and the
  tab bar's bottom room; worth a look on the device.

## Round: Fixtures rebuilt, speed and cost, Rewards and Securities (branch `claude/fixtures-app-restructure-v5tuby`)

Everything is on `claude/fixtures-app-restructure-v5tuby` in all six repos,
not yet on `main` (so not deployed). The Workers (batch, translate, season
tier) deploy from `main` too; until then the apps fall back (one request at
a time; untranslated text).

- **Kit:** `proxyJson` (batches of 12 per Worker request, memory + Cache
  Storage per URL for its lifetime), `peekJson`, `cachedPayload` (a signed-in
  phone opens on its last data at once), `translate()`, account badge
  instead of the balance, account details card in the pass sheet
  (`accountDetails`), `watchUpdates` applies a new deploy when the app is
  put away or right after opening (never under the thumb on coming back),
  `rememberPlace`/`restorePlace`, two-line `.q-rec-sub`.
- **sports-proxy:** `?batch=1&u=…` (`trim!url` per item), `Cache-Control:
  private, max-age` on single answers, `dates=<year>` season tier,
  `clients5.google.com/translate_a/t` (POSTed upstream, kept 30 days).
- **Fixtures:** tabs 推薦 / 賽事 / 直播 / 追蹤 / 排名; stages and playoff
  series (`lib/stage.mjs`); Taiwan broadcasts (`lib/broadcast.mjs`, checked
  2026-09: keep it current); whole seasons for F1/golf/tennis/UFC; table
  gaps; player pages and follows for individual sports; stat bars per side;
  Chinese stat names (`lib/statnames.mjs`).
- **Securities:** 換匯・融資 in three views; translated "what it does"; no
  news; the money-sources card removed (account details are in the kit).
- **Play:** data through `proxyJson`.
- **Rewards:** every word recorded (Microsoft en-US Jenny, like the old
  4-6 clips; `tools/word-audio.py`), audio started in the tap, voice
  fallback/picker (`lib/voice.mjs`); faster boxes (1, 2, 5, 14 days; known
  words jump to box 3), missed words retried in the round, 10/20/30 rounds;
  long games (`lib/long.mjs`: sudoku 9×9, solitaire, minesweeper XL,
  checkers) and word search; full-screen play; help in one shape.
- **All:** top-right is help · refresh · account in every app.
- **Tools:** `tools/preview.mjs` (signed-in phone screenshots with real
  data), `tools/espn.mjs`, `tools/word-audio.py`; see `tools/README.md`.

Ideas for later: Play's own cold-start cache (like Fixtures'), a playoff
bracket view in Fixtures, saving a long game in progress.


## Notices while an app is closed (Web Push)

Phones stop a home-screen app in the background, so notices can't come from
the app itself once it's closed. The kit's `schedulePush(s, items)` hands the
Worker each app's coming notices (a followed game's start and final score, a
class, a streak about to end, a price alert or order reaching its price, a
monthly plan's day, a slip's games being over); `push.js` in the
main Worker stores them in KV and its cron (every 2 minutes) sends the
due ones with Web Push (VAPID key pair made on first use, kept in KV as
`push:vapid`). Checks (`espn` final score, `yahoo` price reached) are made by
the Worker itself. They live on the main Worker (`worker.js`, `/push/*`,
sent by its cron) because only it can read Quadra Pass tokens. Each app's `sw.js` shows them (`push` event). On an iPhone
this needs the app on the home screen (iOS 16.4+) and notices turned on in
the account sheet. Notices that arrive together while the app is open are
one grouped banner.


## Round: profit the smart way, and premium (all repos, pushed to `main`)

The owner asked for Quadra to earn more while looking simple and premium,
and for the cheap cash-grab features to go. What changed:

- **Removed:** Play's 🔥 熱門串關 cards (unreadable, obscure table-tennis
  legs), the dashed "follow in Fixtures" nag, the 試試看 rec cards, the
  dashed 再加一場 upsell; Securities' fake 限時活動 promo strip and the
  現金閒置中 idle-cash nag; Fixtures' gradient 下注 pills and "N 場開賣中"
  banner.
- **Quadra Plus** (the recurring revenue): NT$290 a month, billed by the
  Worker (`op: 'plus'`, renewal in `paydayEntries`, entries
  `eco:plus:<month>`; apps can no longer write `eco:` ids at all). First
  month free once; rejoining costs the rest of the month's share. Perks,
  one table in the kit (`PLUS`): Securities half commission, half FX
  spread, loans 1 point cheaper, 2% on NT$ cash (by paid month); Play
  parlay boost doubled, cash out keeps 2% not 5%. Shown in the account
  sheet (`plusCard`, `openPlus`), once on Play's home and Securities' 資產
  for non-members, and as one quiet "✦ Plus price" line where money is
  spent (order ticket, FX desk, loan form, slip, cash out). A member gets a
  gold star on the account button.
- **Play:** new home (balance, featured big-league games with prices, your
  bets with cash out, jackpots); board orders by league tier and folds the
  thin leagues; **parlay boost** (3+ picks, 5-20%, stored per slip as
  `boost`); **cash out** (`lib/cashout.mjs`, `cashOut` in `account.mjs`).
- **Securities:** markets home = account strip, for you, movers side by
  side; lists capped at 15 rows; Plus perks by time (`usePlus`).
- **Fixtures:** a small outlined 投注 / 場中 chip in its own column.
- **Not done:** Quadra-Rewards wasn't reachable from this session (adding
  it was refused), so its kit copy is one version behind: run
  `node kit/sync.mjs` with Rewards checked out and commit it. Until then
  Rewards has no Plus card in its account sheet (nothing else breaks: every
  app's copy stands alone).
- Ideas: a daily price boost on one marquee game (capped stake); same-game
  parlays (need correlated pricing); a Plus-only monthly statement.

## Round: full throttle (all repos, pushed to `main`)

The owner asked to remove anything that could discourage spending and to
package everything as premium and useful while being profit-first.

- **Removed discouragers (Play):** the 統計分析 tab (net loss, luck vs the
  cut, per-100 returns) is now 戰績, wins only (`stats-ui.js`); slips show
  no expected return, no negative result; groups, the summary and the
  account show 累計中獎 instead of 輸贏; no "lost" filter; the lottery shows
  prizes but no odds, no scratch win rates, no net-loss chips, no purchase
  confirmation. Old analysis strings in `i18n.mjs` are unused leftovers.
- **Play conversion:** sticky slip bar, parlay by default from two picks,
  quick stakes with a remembered stake (NT$500 default), 精選串關 on home,
  "投注成功 · 繼續挑比賽" after a bet.
- **Plus yearly plan:** NT$2,900 for twelve months (entries for all twelve
  at once, the fee on the first), renewed by the year (or by the month if
  the pool can't cover a year). The sheet has a plan picker (yearly marked
  最划算; monthly keeps the one-time free month); cancelling is still there,
  under 管理會員.
- **Securities:** buying power (cash + margin room) on the markets home;
  融資買進 borrows the shortfall and places the order in one tap; 融資最大
  quick size; no "worst trade" line.
- **Fixtures:** match sheets carry a Quadra Play card.
- Rewards now has the current kit (synced in the Rewards round below).

## Round: the economy, balanced so money matters

`node tools/economy.mjs` models five kinds of user (casual, regular bettor,
high roller, investor, Rewards grinder) over a year: faucets (opening money,
allowance, Rewards, market) against sinks (Play's hold: 13.6% of a single,
~33% of a treble; the lottery ~50%, scratch ~32%; trading costs; Plus).

- **Before:** everyone but a whale got richer every month (regular bettor
  +NT$4.5k, investor +12.9k, grinder +28k); balances reached 20-60 months
  of pay, so the house's take never mattered.
- **Now (Worker, live):** a new pass opens with NT$30,000 (was 110,000);
  the monthly allowance goes by worth (pool + Securities holdings, which
  Securities now sends as `snap.stock.holdings`): 6,000 / 4,000 / 2,000 /
  1,000 at < 40k / < 100k / < 250k / above. Existing money is untouched;
  a rich account simply stops getting much for free.
- **Rewards (done, see the Rewards round below):** effort is capped at
  NT$400 a day (vocab 200, games 120, missions 80; about NT$12 a minute).
- With all of it: a regular bettor is about level (needs a little Rewards
  effort to stay there), an investor grows by the market, a grinder earns
  but can't outrun the house, a high roller drains fast.
- **Existing accounts, reset (live):** the Worker adds `eco:rebase:v3`
  (−NT$80,000) once to every account that opened on the old NT$110,000
  (an `eco:start` above 30,000, or a pre-v2 account with money in the
  pool); new passes never get it. The kit shows a one-time notice
  (`quadra.seen.rebase-v3` per device) with the amount and what to do.
- **Overdrafts:** the pool may go negative. Spending is blocked by the apps'
  own balance checks; selling, cash out and the allowance still work. The
  Worker charges 1% a month on what's owed at the month's first read
  (`eco:od:<month>`, from 2026-10). Play's home shows the negative balance
  and "賣出持股補足" (into Securities); Securities shows an overdraft card
  with `coverPlan` (largest holdings first, only what's needed, +1% for
  costs) and one-tap market sells, and a red strip on the markets home.
- `tools/preview.mjs --entry '{json}'` adds wallet entries for scenarios
  (e.g. the reset and a big stake, to see an overdraft).
- **Rewards next:** the brief for Rewards (sync the kit, close the effort
  faucet, make Rewards profit-oriented, remove its loss-talk) is done; see
  the round below.

## Round: Rewards, profit-oriented (done)

- **Kit and caps:** Rewards runs the current kit; pay rescaled to the
  NT$400 day (missions NT$15-25, weekly goals 40-60, the daily challenge
  bonus 5-20); ranks start at NT$50,000. Home shows the cap as progress
  (今日可賺 NT$400 · 已賺 …) and one quiet line into Play and Securities.
- **Shop (`Quadra-Rewards/public/lib/shop.mjs`):** 連續紀錄保護卡 NT$300
  (hold 3, used by itself on a missed day: `vocab:fz:<day>`, amount 0);
  word pay ×2 for 30 minutes NT$150 (that day's word cap +200); word packs
  TOEIC NT$990 / IELTS 1,490 / Business 1,990 (`data/packs.json`, about 150
  themed words each sharing progress with the main list, 212 new words
  recorded). Purchases are `vocab:shop:<item>:<key>` entries of kind
  `shop`; the Worker drops any that pays less than the lowest price
  (`REWARDS_SHOP` in eco.js), so a free card or pack can't be written.
- **Plus in Rewards:** a protection card every Plus month, word cap +NT$50,
  packs half price; the kit's `plusPerks` and Plus sheet list them.
- **Free bets (Rewards missions → Play):** three missions (a parlay of 3+
  in Play, a scratch card, a monthly plan in Securities) give a token
  instead of cash: `vocab:fb:<day>:<mission>`, kind `freebet`, amount 0,
  its value (NT$30-50) in the note; the Worker keeps only well-formed ones.
  Play's slip offers unspent tokens (kit `freeBets`, 7 days): one slip, the
  token's value as stake, nothing off the balance, the token marked spent
  (`odds:fb-<token id>`), a win pays the winnings only (`placeFreeSlip`,
  `applyResults`), no cash out. Play tracks `parlay` and `scratch`,
  Securities `plan`, for the missions.
- **No betting in Rewards:** a staked game challenge was built and then
  removed at the owner's word (betting belongs to Play only).
- **說明** is a product guide now: no expected losses, per-100 returns or
  "simulated" wording; Plus monthly/yearly, allowance by worth, overdraft,
  fees, parlay boost, cash out, free bets, the shop and packs.
- **Kit statement labels:** `shop` (Rewards 加值), `freeze`, `freebet`.
- `tools/economy.mjs` has a v4 setting (the shop and free bets) and a
  Rewards-only persona (只背單字).

## Round: one tab bar, faster opening, clean-up (all repos, pushed to `main`)

- **One app frame (kit):** `tabBar({ tabs, onSelect })` draws every app's
  tab bar from the same markup and icons (`ICONS`): on a phone the chosen
  tab has a pill behind its icon, badges sit on the icon (`badge(id, n, {
  tone })`), each tab keeps its place, tapping the open tab scrolls it to
  the top (at the top: `onSelect(id, { again: true })`), arrow keys move
  between tabs, and only a change of tab moves the address.
  `topActions(s, { help, refresh, extra })` is the top right everywhere:
  help, refresh (apps with live data), the account. Every index.html has
  the same header (`.q-appbar`, `#title`, `#status`, `#tabs`,
  `#top-actions`); the apps' own header, tab and mobile-bar CSS is gone.
  Page padding uses the kit's `--q-nav` and `--q-page-max`.
- **Tabs:** the first tab is 首頁 (house) in every app (Fixtures' 推薦 and
  Securities' 市場 renamed). Fixtures gained a refresh button (tap 首頁
  again at the top: back to today). **Rewards:** 首頁 · 單字 · 遊戲 · 任務;
  任務 has every mission, weekly goals, badges and ranks with a count of
  what's ready to claim; home keeps the next three missions; help is a
  sheet from the ? (and from other apps' `#help=` links). Help text and
  READMEs follow.
- **Faster opening:** each sw.js serves the kept page at once and
  refreshes it behind (`pageFirst`; a `?v=` address, the update reload,
  still asks the network): an installed app no longer waits a round trip.
  Deploys add `modulepreload` for the whole static import graph
  (`scripts/stamp-version.mjs`): 3 waves of requests instead of 5-6
  (measured with `tools/preview.mjs --timing --latency 150 --root`). The
  Worker is preconnected in every app. The kit's session shares one
  sign-in call when several token requests come at once (test in
  `tests/kit.test.mjs`).
- **Clean-up:** ~1,400 unused i18n entries (Play's old analysis,
  leaderboards and simulator; Securities' lessons and costs card; a few
  in Fixtures and Rewards), unused CSS rules and keyframes, dead
  functions, constants and imports (checked with `tsc --checkJs
  --noUnusedLocals`: nothing unresolved, nothing unused), the unused
  `useSession` hooks, Play's stray `undefined/` screenshots and dead
  `build` script, and the finished `docs/REWARDS-NEXT.md`. Tests that
  listed keys of removed screens were updated.
- Not changed on purpose: Fixtures still holds its loading screen until
  the picks settle (a cached day without its tables would reshuffle on
  screen); Play's first-ever open is bound by its odds sources (later
  opens draw the saved board at once).
- Orbit Class wasn't in this session: its kit copy is one version behind
  (it doesn't use the tab bar; run `node kit/sync.mjs` with it checked
  out).

## Round: live everywhere (Play, Fixtures, sports-proxy)

The owner saw Play's live betting vanish once games started and Fixtures'
直播 show only the big games.

- **Play's 場中 covered MLB and the Premier League only**; every other game
  left the board at its start with nowhere to go. Now every league Play
  sells has live betting:
  - Kambi's sports (NPB, KBO, CPBL, EuroLeague, B.League, tennis,
    badminton, table tennis, volleyball, snooker): Kambi's own live prices
    (`listView/<league>/in-play.json`, `parseKambiInPlay`), margin out,
    the house's live cut; winner, and for baseball and basketball the main
    handicap and total. A suspended price isn't offered.
  - Every ESPN soccer league: the soccer model (three-way winner, totals).
  - NHL: goals left by the share of the clock (`liveGoals`); NFL, NCAAF,
    NBA, WNBA, NCAA basketball: the points model scaled to the clock left
    (`livePoints`, `shareLeft`).
  - Which ESPN leagues are read: MLB and the Premier League always, and
    any league whose scoreboard (read for the board) had a start within
    its sport's length (`liveLeagues`). Pregame lines from those
    scoreboards, else the game's summary (a failed read is retried).
  - The live cut is `houseCut({ base: 'live' })` (MLB and the Premier
    League unchanged; lesser leagues a little more). `ODDS_ERROR.liveOther`.
  - Fixed on the way: `pointsMarkets` with no posted spread put its main
    handicap on the wrong side (`half(-margin)`), so such games got none.
- **Fixtures' 直播** read only the followed leagues and those on Taiwan TV
  (up to 24). Once it's open it now also reads every other league's
  current scoreboard (`loadRest`), so every game on anywhere is listed,
  headline leagues first in each sport; the tab's badge counts them all.
- **sports-proxy:** Kambi `…/in-play.json` is cached 20 s (was the 2-minute
  pre-match tier); the Kambi trim keeps each price's `status` and the
  match clock.


## Round: Asian baseball, sports split, next game day, F1 pole, one catalogue

- **Asian baseball in Fixtures:** Kambi lists NPB, KBO and CPBL only a day
  or so ahead (none at all some days), so 賽事 said "no recent games"
  mid-season. The sports proxy now gathers them from the leagues' own
  sites (`asia-baseball.js`: npb.jp's monthly page, koreabaseball.com's
  monthly list, cpbl.com.tw's season list with its anti-forgery token;
  TheSportsDB's day lists for CPBL when its site refuses) and answers as
  `https://asia-baseball.quadra/<league>/<YYYY-MM>.json` (this month and
  next a minute fresh). Fixtures reads them (`asiaEvents`), past games
  with scores, home and away, void rain-outs. Play still prices them from
  Kambi when Kambi has them.
- **One catalogue (`kit/leagues.mjs`, synced as `lib/catalog.mjs`):** every
  sport and league once, with where each app reads it (`data` for
  Fixtures, `bet` / `odds` for Play). Fixtures' `lib/leagues.mjs` and
  Play's `LEAGUES` (`lib/teams.mjs`) are views of it (Play's table was
  checked equal, all 62 leagues). Add or fix a league there, run
  `node kit/sync.mjs`, commit both apps. The Asian baseball reader
  (`asiaMonth`) lives there too.
- **球拍與其他 split:** 羽球, 桌球, 排球, 司諾克 are sports of their own;
  a saved `racket` follow becomes the ones of its followed leagues (all
  four if none).
- **賽事** opens on the day with a game on (today first), else the next
  game day however far (it used to stop at 4 days, then showed the last
  round).
- **F1:** 排位賽第一 (pole position) in Play until qualifying starts:
  Polymarket's driver pole market when open, Kambi's if it lists one, else
  the winner's chances sharpened (`f1PoleFromWinner`, unchecked); settled
  from ESPN's `Qual` session (`parseEspnPole`). Play reads ESPN's whole F1
  season (`dates=<year>`): the plain scoreboard stays on the last race all
  week, so the qualifying time (and the winner board's before/after
  qualifying prices) was missing until the weekend. Fixtures: 投注 on F1
  qualifying and races (rows and sheets) opens Play's F1 board
  (`#game=f1` / `#game=f1pole`); Play's link also finds a game already
  live, and teams spelt differently by the two sources.

## Round: live on both homes, UFC/NRL/AFL in Play, one set of links, flags

The owner saw no live game recommended on home, UFC in Fixtures but not in
Play, no CPBL schedule, letters for table-tennis players, Fixtures→Play links
that didn't land on live games, and text cut on phones.

- **Fixtures 首頁 opened on tomorrow while games were live:** a day read
  before the pass's follows arrived (zero leagues) counted as "nothing on
  today", so `autoDay` jumped ahead. Days now remember the leagues they were
  read for (`leaguesKey`), are read again when those change, and never jump
  from a saved or half-read day. 首頁 opens with **正在進行** (the person's
  games on now, ranked like the picks; with none of theirs on, the best of
  everything on now), taken out of the lists below. Today's rest (every
  league's current scoreboard) is read a moment after the first read, so
  直播's badge is the same number everywhere.
- **Play 首頁: 場中焦點**, live games with live win prices, ranked like
  焦點賽事; the live board refreshes on home too. (Also fixed: reopening Play
  on home with a saved board threw on `balance(null)` and threw the saved
  board away, so every reopen was a cold start.)
- **Delayed ≠ postponed:** ESPN's `STATUS_DELAYED` / rain delays were void
  (延期) in Fixtures while Play had them live. Now `status.delayed`: 延遲開賽
  before the start, "· 暫停" during.
- **UFC, NRL, AFL, FA Cup in Play** (catalogue: `bet`, `odds: 'kambi'`,
  `results` / `scores`): UFC bouts from Kambi (`ufc_mma/ufc`, winner only),
  settled from ESPN's card (`parseEspnFight`, either order, draw/NC void),
  fighters' flags from ESPN's cards (`rememberFighterFlags`); NRL and AFL
  from Kambi with the points model (`SCORE_SPREAD.nrl/afl`, whole-game markets
  only), settled from ESPN (`findEspnGame`, club words, sides turned when
  needed); the FA Cup from ESPN like any soccer league. All four simulated
  (`SIM_SPORTS`). **K League removed:** ESPN answers 400 for `kor.1`, no source.
  **Not in Play:** golf, NASCAR, IndyCar (Kambi's public feed has no clean
  winner market for them: several unlabeled "Finishing Position" offers for
  golf, nothing for the series); Fixtures-only.
- **Links Fixtures → Play:** `playTarget(e)` in Fixtures' ui.js is the one
  place (rows, cards, sheets): `game=<id>` for games, `league=<key>` for a
  fight card or tennis draw, F1 as before; each bout and draw match in a
  sheet has its own chip (`playPairId`). Play: `#league=<key>` opens that
  league once its games are in; a wanted game matches players in either
  order, opens its **live card first** (the board can still hold it from
  before the start), never the same clubs' next-day game (a baseball series;
  the id match is kept within 12 h), and reads the game's league live even
  if the board didn't list it (`loadLive(…, extra)`). Not found once every
  league and the live list are in: its league's board with a line saying
  why (`wanted-note`).
- **CPBL schedule:** cpbl.com.tw's season list stopped at September's last
  game while the season had a week to go (October returned 0). The proxy now
  fills the days after its last game from TheSportsDB (`mergeCpbl`, day lists
  cached 10 min at the edge).
- **Players' flags** (kit `playerNation`, `playerFlag`, `flagUrl`: circle
  flags from jsDelivr, emoji fallback): a table of the tours' regulars
  (table tennis, badminton, snooker, tennis), else the country Kambi files the
  match under (its path words, now kept by the proxy's Kambi trim, or a
  domestic series' name: TT Elite Series → Poland, Czech Liga Pro → Czechia).
  Catalogue `players: true` marks those leagues (tennis, UFC too).
- **Nothing cut on a phone:** live status, league names, live lines, event
  titles, side names and fighter names wrap to two lines; table tennis,
  badminton and volleyball periods read 第N局 (tennis 第N盤); card and golf
  statuses in Chinese (選手進場, 第2回合, 第2輪 進行中); ESPN's last play
  translated in the match sheet; Play hides Kambi groups that only repeat the
  league ("中職 · Chinese Professional Baseball"), and shows the catalogue's
  headline leagues (CPBL) with the majors instead of folding them away.
- **`node tools/leagues-audit.mjs`**: every catalogue league against its real
  sources (Fixtures' schedule, Play's prices), one line each. Off-season and
  Kambi-empty days (B.League before its season, badminton and volleyball
  between events) show 0 there; that's the source, not the apps.

## Round: broadcasts, Chinese everywhere, sheets (branch `claude/live-games-recommendation-consistency-nm0x4l`)

- **ELTA's own schedule** (`piceltaott-elta.cdn.hinet.net/…/sports_live_program_list.json`,
  two weeks ahead; allowed and always trimmed by the proxy: `trimElta`, kept
  30 min). Fixtures' `lib/broadcast.mjs` (`parseElta`, `eltaPrograms`,
  `broadcastsFor`) and `lib/tv.mjs` (`tvOf`, `channelsOf`) match each program
  to its game: same league, starting an hour before to 20 min after, either
  side's Chinese name (`zhSame`: two characters in a row, so 里茲聯 = 利茲聯).
  A program without the sides ("【onELTA 熱身賽】") goes to the only game near
  it, or is marked 同時段擇一，待公布. Inside the schedule's days a game ELTA
  doesn't carry isn't said to be on ELTA (the NBA: one game a day, from the
  preseason's 10/6; `NBA_ELTA_FROM`); beyond them, the league list with the
  NBA's note. Channels: 101/105/110/115 = 愛爾達體育1–4台 (MOD, cable,
  ELTA.tv; Hami Video too), 540–549 = ELTA.tv 體育MAX1–10台; each has its
  ELTA.tv watch page (`eltaWatchUrl`). Shown: a 📺 line under each game ELTA
  carries, the pick cards' chips, a 台灣轉播 card with watch links in the
  match sheet, and 直播's 愛爾達轉播表 (now and the next 12 h). "Your
  services" picks use each game's own channels.
- **Teams in Chinese:** kit `names.mjs` (synced to both apps as
  `lib/names.mjs`): MLB, NBA, WNBA, NFL, NHL (city + nickname: rows show the
  nickname, 海盜), Europe's clubs and MLS (one name, any competition), NPB,
  KBO, CPBL (統一獅 in a row). Play's `teamZh` is the kit's now (NFL, NHL,
  soccer beyond the EPL gained names). Fixtures' `localSide` puts the Chinese
  in `name`/`short` and keeps the English in `en`: Play ids, follows (the
  pass keeps English: Play matches by it), affinity keys (`eventKeys`) and
  ELTA matching use `en`. National sides by the kit's `countryName` (Intl).
  People keep their names (F1's drivers take the lottery's, as in Play).
- **More in Chinese:** statuses (Final/OT → 終場（延長）…), standings groups
  (`groupZh`), standing lines, positions (`posZh`), injury lists
  (`injuryZh`), series lines (`seriesLineZh`), weather in °C, leaders'
  values, baseball pitches (`pitchZh`: a translator read "Strike" as a
  labour strike), fixed words for rounds, hands and stances (`fixedWord`,
  before `translate()`), metric heights and weights, dates.
- **投注 only where Play has it** (`lib/playable.mjs`): ESPN leagues need
  DraftKings' line on the scoreboard (`priced`) and the game inside Play's
  reach (MLB 8 days, soccer 21, others 7.5); Kambi leagues need the pair in
  Kambi's priced list (read once asked, the page redrawn when it comes).
- **Search:** ESPN files soccer clubs and players without a league id
  (`s:600~t:382`): found by `defaultLeagueSlug` now (Man City was missing).
  A league result opens the league (the search query used to redraw over it).
- **Clubs:** a soccer club is read across all its competitions
  (`soccer/all/teams/<id>/schedule` + `?fixture=true`: its next games showed
  none before) and its squad from its own league (`defaultLeague`: a cup's
  list can be last season's); each game says its competition.
- **Players:** F1 drivers get the championship (place, points, gap), race by
  race results, the next race and their team; tennis players the world
  ranking and this season's matches (`rankings`, `playerMatches`).
- **首頁's date strip has no end:** it grows two weeks at either end as it's
  scrolled, and 📅 opens the date picker for any day.
- **Sheets:** win probability labelled away left / home right (adding up to
  100) with the chart's ends named; batter and pitcher on their own line on
  a phone; form pills under their label; squad grouped by position, long
  names wrap; the main bout first on a fight card; line scores by Chinese
  names.

## Round: notice switches follow the pass; Securities' notices

- **Synced switches (kit):** system notices on/off and every kind's switch
  are the wallet setting `notify` (`{ on, off: ['stock:alert', …] }`,
  newest wins), so every app and device shows the same ones (home-screen
  apps on a phone don't share storage). `notifyPrefs`, `setNotifyOn`,
  `setKind(app, kind, on, s)`, `adoptNotifyPrefs`, `syncPrefs`; the
  device's copy is `quadra.notify.prefs` (the old `quadra.notify` /
  `quadra.notify.kinds` are no longer read). A device
  or app the phone hasn't allowed yet gets a one-tap 允許 banner
  (`offerNotices`, once a week at most).
- **Worker (`push.js`):** `POST /push/prefs` keeps the switches
  (`push:prefs:<account>`); each notice keeps its `kind`, and `sendDue`
  drops what's switched off (in any app) or everything when notices are
  off, so a closed app's list obeys at once.
- **Securities:** new kinds `order` (lapsed/dropped orders, skipped plans),
  `margin` (margin call once a day, forced sales), `income` (ex-dividend,
  dividends, coupons, interest); `fill` also covers plan buys. Toasts open
  their tab when tapped; in-app banners (`#portfolio` …) now switch tabs
  (`hashchange`); a pending dividend's pay day is a push while closed.

## Round: fewer, bigger leagues; pro events only; Asia and the national teams

- **Removed:** second divisions and college basketball, and Austria, Switzerland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden,
  Greece, Colombia, Chile, A-League, Chinese Super League, NWSL, NRL, AFL,
  NASCAR, IndyCar (the `aussie` sport and Play's short-lived NASCAR/IndyCar
  board with them).
- **Pro events only** (catalogue `pro`, `kambiKept(key, event)`): Kambi's
  table tennis (WTT, ITTF, title events; not Czech Liga Pro, TT Elite
  Series…), volleyball (national teams, top leagues, big club events) and
  rugby union (internationals, the Champions Cup). Both apps and
  `tools/leagues-audit.mjs` apply it.
- **Added:** AFC Champions League Elite, the Asian Cup and international
  friendlies (ESPN), Liga ACB and the NBL (Kambi, basketball family),
  international rugby union (`rugbyunion`: Kambi's schedule and prices,
  results from ESPN's rugby competitions, `scores` a list of paths).
- **Play:** 場中 only on today's board (the day strip keeps today while
  games are on).
- **Cups were empty:** ESPN's calendar for a cup or the national teams is a
  list of stages and its default page can be a past round (the Europa
  League's showed Sept 17). Play now reads every ESPN league by its months'
  pages (`fetchMonths`, odds included, far fewer requests); Fixtures reads
  such leagues by months (`parseCalendar` → `{ months: true }`,
  `monthsBetween`), and both read soccer's live games from dated pages.
- **Loading screens:** Play waits for the whole board (leagues join one by
  one via `loadExtraLeagues(now, onPart)`, capped at `BOOT_FULL_MS`); last
  season's standings never hold the board (2.5 s). Securities retries its
  first prices behind the loading screen (8 s cap). Worker batches: an item
  not answered in 3 s answers 504 (the app re-asks it alone; its fetch goes
  on into the cache), so one slow upstream can't hold eleven others.
  `tools/preview.mjs` mirrors both (8 s upstream limit, 3 s batch items) and
  DEBUG prints each request's start and duration.
- **More added:** the World Cup, Euro, Copa América and Club World Cup
  (ESPN, month pages: empty between tournaments); K League 1 (Kambi soccer:
  three-way prices, `scoreOnly`, settled by `decidedTeamGame` from the last
  score), CBA and KBL (Kambi); international cricket (`PRO_CRICKET`, results
  from ESPN's `cricket/scorepanel`, `parseCricketPanel`); boxing (Kambi's
  bouts kept only when on a TheSportsDB card, `notable` / `notableFight`,
  results from its write-ups, `boxingResult`, void after 5 days unknown).
  Play's basketball filter group now follows the catalogue.
- **Play's first screen** is the balance and the games on now too: the
  loading screen waits for the account (read, merged with the pass:
  `state.accountIn`) and the live games, from a saved board as well
  (`SNAPSHOT_WAIT_MS`), and up to 2.5 s for the logos in view.
- **Pictures for every sport:** league badges (TheSportsDB) for ACB, NBL,
  CBA, KBL, K League, rugby, cricket and boxing; club badges for ACB, NBL,
  CBA, KBL and K League (`TEAM_BADGES`, looked up one by one: the free key
  lists 10 teams a league); national sides a round flag (`countryCode`;
  England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland their own); tennis players the
  flag in ESPN's draw (`parseFighterFlags` reads draws too; either name
  order); boxers their nation from TheSportsDB's player pages, kept on the
  device (`learnFighterNations`, `rememberNation`) plus `BOXER_NATIONS`.

## Round: the economy, v5 (all repos, pushed to `main`)

The owner asked to balance the economy again, leaving the opening money
(NT$30,000) alone. `node tools/economy.mjs` showed v4 (the shop and free
bets on top of v3) leaving everyone but the high roller richer every month:
a regular bettor +NT$2.7k, a grinder +8.6k, a Rewards-only learner +15.5k,
an idle account doubling in five months.

- **Allowance (Worker, `PAY_TIERS` in eco.js; kit `ECONOMY.payTiers`):**
  6,000 / 3,000 / 1,500 / 500 at < 40k / < 100k / < 250k / above (was
  6,000 / 4,000 / 2,000 / 1,000). The first tier is unchanged, so a new or
  broke account still gets going; past it a regular bettor is now about
  level (−NT$0.3k a month in the model) and settles near NT$40,000.
  Live from the first payday, 2026-10.
- **Rewards' day (kit `ECONOMY`):** NT$330 (words 150, games 120, missions
  60), was 400 (200 / 120 / 80). Games keep 120 so a long round still pays
  in full. Missions pay NT$10-20 (was 15-25) and weekly goals 30-45 (was
  40-60), so about as many fit under the lower cap. Plus still adds NT$50
  to words (the perk line reads the cap); the boost still adds 200.
- **Model after 12 months (v4 → v5):** casual 75k → 65k, regular 46k →
  41k (level), investor 115k → 107k (grows by the market), grinder 111k →
  78k (+3.5k a month), learner 182k → 166k, high roller still broke in a
  month.
- Text: Rewards' help (the allowance and the day's caps), its README money
  table (was stale since v3), Play's practice-account line, the kit's reset
  notice range and Plus perk line.
- Left alone on purpose: the house's cuts (Play and the lottery copy Taiwan
  Sports Lottery / Taiwan Lottery), Securities' costs (a Taiwan broker's),
  Plus's price, the shop's prices, the overdraft rate.
- Seen, not changed: the `plan` mission counts saving a monthly plan in
  Securities, so re-saving one each day earns its NT$50 free bet daily
  (worth ~NT$22 at a free bet's ~45% return).

## Round: the business model (all repos, pushed to `main`)

The owner asked to run Quadra like a profit-minded business, generous where
it pays back, realistic throughout. `node tools/economy.mjs` has a v6
setting and a table of the house's side per user (gaming take, promotions
and their share of it, commission, Plus and shop, house net), member and
not. Real sportsbooks spend 20-30% of their gaming take on promotions;
Quadra stays under 30% for anyone who plays much.

- **Quadra Plus, reworked (NT$390 a month, NT$3,900 a year; was 290 /
  2,900):** Play: a daily +10% winnings boost on one paid slip up to
  NT$1,000 (`lift` on the slip; 10% is under every market's cut, so the
  house stays ahead at any price; paid as `plus-<slip>`, kind
  `plusboost`), a NT$100 free bet each week (the Worker's
  `eco:fb:<Monday>`, `plusBonusEntries`), parlay boost doubled, cash out 2%.
  Securities: commission 2.8折 (was 5折). Rewards: every word pack while a
  member (`packOpen`, `packIncluded`; bought packs stay), +NT$50 words, a
  protection card a month. The Plus card and sheet show what Plus gave
  back this month (`plusReturns`: boosts paid and bonus bets). Price moved
  with the value: a regular bettor gets back about 3× the fee; Plus makes
  money on casual members. Existing monthly members renew at NT$390;
  yearly ones keep what they paid.
- **VIP cashback (free, by activity):** a Taiwan month's gaming stakes in
  Play (bets, lottery, scratch; less refunds) set its tier: 🥉 10k 0.5%,
  🥈 50k 0.8%, 🥇 150k 1.2%, ◆ 500k 1.5%. The Worker pays it on the first
  read after the month (`eco:vip:<month>`, kind `vip`, from 2026-10, so
  the first on 1 November). Every product keeps 14%+; cash out keeps 2-5%
  of a price that already has the cut, so churning can't farm it. Play's
  balance card shows the tier, the cashback so far and the next step.
- **Welcome offers:** the first paid bet in Play brings a NT$200 free bet
  (`eco:fb:welcome`, `welcomeEntries`); Securities' first trade pays no
  commission (`withWelcome` / `firstTrade`). A Worker PATCH now also
  writes what's due (payday entries, fixed ids), so the welcome bet lands
  right after the bet.
- **Rewards:** mission free bets 30 / 20 / 30 (were 50 / 30 / 50: the
  biggest promotion); the plan mission counts only a plan for a symbol
  that never had one (re-saving no longer farms it).
- Kit: `VIP`, `vipStatus`, `vipName`, `WELCOME`, `welcomeDue`,
  `plusReturns`; statement labels `plusboost`, `vip`, `welcome`; free
  bets read the Worker's `eco:fb:` tokens too.
- Model (a month at NT$40,000): a regular non-member leaves the house
  ~NT$7.2k (promos 10% of take) and nets −NT$0.6k; as a member ~NT$6.3k
  (27%) and nets +NT$0.4k. A high roller as a member: promos 10%.
- Not done: a featured-game odds boost for everyone (board-wide price
  changes; Plus's daily boost covers the need), tiered commission by
  volume in Securities.

## 2026-10-01: sign-out wipes the device, older versions' support removed

- **Sign-out wipes the device (kit `wipeDevice`):** signing out, by hand or
  because the pass signed this device out, clears every key in this
  storage (every app's: the account, wallet, each app's copy, its
  settings), sessionStorage and the `quadra-data-v1` cache. Only
  `quadra.lang` and `quadra.safeBottom` stay; the app files stay cached.
  On a phone each home-screen app has its own storage, so it wipes the one
  it's in.
- **Older versions' support removed:** the kit no longer trades in a pass
  older versions kept (`quadra.pass`, `q.oldPass`), derives the account id
  for a refresh token without one, reads the pre-pass notice switches
  (`quadra.notify`, `quadra.notify.kinds`) or turns batching off for a
  proxy without batches. `boot.js` knows only `window.__fxStarted` (Play
  and Securities set it now). Play reads only `oddsStudy.account:<pass>`
  (not the bare pre-pass copy) and its one-off `splitOnce` repair is gone;
  Securities drops its old device copy, `linkOldLoans`/`link` events and
  the unused sync-code key. The Worker's Gemini route takes only `files`
  (not the single `image`); Orbit Class reads only the `classes` array from
  it and no longer clears the old sync-code keys.
- **Kept on purpose:** readers of data still stored on passes (Orbit
  Class's kept schedule: countdown `date`, a stored `proSecondary`; the
  plain-JSON saves `codec.mjs` reads, which is also what `pack` writes
  without CompressionStream; Play's `compactAccount`), and the 錢從哪裡來
  handling of accounts older than the shared wallet.

## 2026-10-03: Orbit Weather — today from the top, kept fresh, its own pictures, smoother

- **The top opens today:** the whole top of a page (now, high/low, the
  sentence) is a button (`role="button"`, Enter/space too) opening today's
  day sheet; its foot says 「更新於 …」 and 「今天詳情 ›」.
- **Kept fresh (researched):** Google's current conditions change every 15
  minutes and its hourly/daily forecast every 30 (its Weather API FAQ); CWA's
  township forecasts every 6 hours and station readings hourly; MOENV's AQI
  hourly and its air forecast 3 times a day. So: the proxy keeps a cell 15
  minutes but asks Google's forecast only every 30 (`GOOGLE_FC_MS`; a rebuild
  in between asks its current conditions alone, 1 call not 4, `fcAt` keeps
  the forecast's time) — more refreshes fit under the 450-a-day cap. The app
  judges a copy by when the proxy made it (`f.at`, `dataAge`), not when it
  arrived: an old copy the proxy answered while refreshing (`refreshing`) is
  asked again 20 s later (`RETRY_MS`, once), nothing twice within 2 minutes
  (`RECHECK_MS`). While the app is on screen a minute tick moves the
  「更新於」 times, redraws on the hour, and asks again once the page's
  forecast is 15 minutes old. The page shows a small spinner while it asks.
- **Its own pictures, no emoji:** `lib/icons.mjs` — colour weather pictures
  by kind (`conditionKind` in format.mjs; gradients once per page,
  `ICON_DEFS`), line glyphs for advice, info, chips, headings, the moon drawn
  in its phase. `conditionIcon` (emoji) stays for notices only. A test fails
  if an emoji reaches a page.
- **Smoother:** the next 24 hours under the top (8 columns every 3 hours,
  fitted, the temperatures a gentle curve; a column opens its day); advice
  sorted warnings first, four shown, the rest behind 「更多建議」; the sky
  behind the top moves (rain falling, stars, drifting cloud, a storm's
  flash; off with reduced motion); sheets slide up and down, pull the
  handle down to close, swipe sideways in a day's sheet for the next day;
  rows press; the instruction lines (「點一下看圖」…) gone.

## F1 數據 live, 2026-10-11 (Singapore GP, during the race)

- **Every lap, live:** F1's archive gives a session's laps only after the
  flag (OpenF1 is paid while a session runs), so the sports proxy now has a
  cron each minute Thu–Mon UTC (`wrangler.sports-proxy.toml`) that, while
  `liveSession` finds a session started and not archived, samples each car's
  last lap into the `F1Log` Durable Object (SQLite, free plan). `laps.json`
  serves that log until the archive has the session. About 1,000 cron
  requests a day on those days; one look at the cached index when nothing runs.
- `now.json` and the archive's laps also carry `places` (LapSeries: every
  car's place on every lap from the grid) and `stops` (PitStopSeries); the
  snapshot carries race control's last 8 messages (`messages`, no blue flags).
- Race control in Chinese (`Quadra-Fixtures/public/lib/racecontrol.mjs`) is
  rule-based by FIA's sentence shapes; its test reads one of each shape of
  every 2025–26 message (`tests/fixtures/racecontrol-2025-2026.json`): add
  new ones there when F1 writes something new.
- The compare card (`f1LapCompare`) is one table, a column a driver; the
  gap chart is counted back from the gap now by lap times (`gapsBetween`),
  since the minute looks read the gaps mid-lap.

## 今日推薦's finals, 2026-10-12

- **A notice for each pick's final score** (Orbit Sports, kit kind
  `match:pickend`, 今日推薦賽果, its own switch): the same Worker check as a
  followed team's `end`, the body "{result} · league · 今日推薦", the tag
  `end:<league>:<id>`, so a followed team's game that's also a pick is said
  once. It's sent for the day's picks as they stood before anything started
  (`ownWas` in `renderHome`), not the list now, because a pick on now (or
  about to start) has left 今日推薦 for 正在進行. They're kept on the device
  for the day (`fx.picked.v1`). An open app says it at once
  (`noticeChanges`).

## Weather's day sheet redrawn, updates sooner, 2026-10-13

- **The owner:** the day sheet "real ugly, we need to step up" (screenshot:
  today 10/13, 學校 → 家, 31°/24°, dry, UV 7, AQI 138), and "speed up
  weather app updating time".
- **Day sheet** (`Orbit-Weather/public/lib/graph.mjs` `dayCharts`): one frame
  for all three charts, the plot 310 of 340 wide (`DAY_PW`) and the scale in
  a gutter on its right, so no number sits on a line (31°'s label had covered
  the 32° mark, 最低 24 was cut at the edge). Temperature's line and fill are
  coloured by the temperature (cold blue → hot red), the fill fading down;
  feels-like a thin dashed grey under it. 最高 / 最低 sit on their dots with
  a halo, anchored inward at the edges. Rain is a bar an hour (the amount
  darker inside); a dry day (under 10%, no amount) has no chart, only
  「不會下雨」 or 「最高 5%」 in its header (was a big empty chart with a flat
  line at 0). UV is its level-coloured line, peak marked, scale 3 / 6 / 11.
  The crosshair reads the plot's width (`data-pw` in `colAt` / `colSpot`).
  The summary's four columns are as wide as their words (對敏感族群不健康 ran
  off the card). Checked in Chromium at 375 px on a hot dry day, a wet
  24-hour day and a cool day; WebKit isn't in this container, not yet seen
  on a phone.
- **Updating:** an answer the proxy is still finishing (`more`) or an old
  copy it's refreshing (`refreshing`) is asked again after 1.2 s, then every
  2 s, 7 times (was 2.5 s, then 4 s, 5 times); the proxy waits up to 4 s for
  a cell's refresh before answering with the old copy (`FRESH_WAIT_MS`, was
  2.5 s), so a slower refresh still comes back in the first answer.
- **The UV, rain and air sheets too** (the owner: "do the same"): one
  `chart` for every graph, the day sheet's rain and UV included (no second
  drawing of the same thing). The scale in the right gutter (`PLOT_W`),
  labels anchored inward; UV a level-coloured line, its fill faded by a
  mask; rain a bar an hour (no bar at 0), and dry hours 「不會下雨」 at the
  graph's height so a tab change doesn't move the sheet; the 「深色＝雨量」
  note only when there's an amount; air's header no longer wraps (its level
  under the number; 「最差 …」 dropped, the graph shows it).
- **The sheets' ranges by day** (the owner: "today, 48 and 10 days is kind
  of weird"): every sheet's tabs are 今天 / 明天 / the days. 今天 is now to
  midnight; from 18:00 it's 今晚 and runs on to 07:00 (the night and the
  way out in the morning). Rain lost 24 h / 48 h; air gained hourly 今天 and
  明天 from `air.hourly` (Google's hours pulled to the station), 每天 its old
  bars; without hours air shows the days alone. UV kept its daylight days.
